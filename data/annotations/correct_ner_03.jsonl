{"text": "\ufeffLet me start by extending my\nsincere congratulations to the President of the General\nAssembly and his country, Serbia, upon his election to preside over the sixty-seventh session. I am confident\nthat, with his extensive experience and diplomatic skill,\nhe will lead this session of the General Assembly to\na successful conclusion. I pledge the support of the\nEritrean delegation for his noble efforts for the common\ngood.\nI wish to pay profound tribute to the outgoing\nPresident, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his\ncommendable work at the sixty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. He indeed served us well. I would\nalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for\nhis leadership and his report (A/67/2) on the work of\nour United Nations at the outset of this general debate.\nAlmost seven decades have elapsed since the\nestablishment of the United Nations, and, undoubtedly,\nthe world has seen much political, economic, social\nand technological progress. However, it is clear that\nthe United Nations has not succeeded in its paramount\npurpose of saving humankind from the scourge of\nwar. In the past 67 years, there has hardly been one in\nwhich no war raged somewhere in the world. What is\nparticularly significant is the fact that in most of these\nwars, the major Powers were the main architects and\nactors \u2014 those same Powers which, by virtue of their\nposition in the Security Council, should have shouldered\nthe greatest responsibility in the maintenance of peace\nand stability.\nOn another front, and again despite the progress\nmade, in the twenty-first century, hundreds of\nmillions of people in the developing world, as well as\nin developed countries, continue to suffer from the\nscourge of poverty, easily preventable diseases and\navoidable premature deaths.\nIn addition to the twin scourges of war and\npoverty, our world now faces an environmental threat\nthat puts human livelihoods and survival at risk. It is\ntherefore disconcerting that the current global political,\neconomic and security architecture is inadequate to\naddress the challenges that we all face. The United\nNations system, as has been repeatedly pointed out,\nis indeed outdated. The General Assembly has been\nemasculated. The Security Council is dominated by\none powerful permanent member, and is increasingly\nbecoming paralysed. Change is being resisted by\nthose who believe they have benefited from the old,\nanachronistic order. Respect for the sovereign equality\nand territorial integrity of nations and non-interference\nin their internal affairs \u2014 which constitute the\npillars of international law and the Charter of the United Nations \u2014 are being eroded and wilfully\nf louted. The noble aims of protecting human rights\nand civilian lives are being selectively and cynically\nemployed to justify military aggression, external\nintervention and imposition of sanctions \u2014 collective\nas well as unilateral \u2014 to destabilize nations, change\nGovernments and gain economic advantages.\nThis summary assessment, Eritrea believes, is\nshared by the majority of States Members of the United\nNations. It is indeed the position of Africa, of most\ndeveloping countries, the Non-Aligned Movement, the\nemerging Powers and many in the developed world.\nWhat this emerging consensus now needs is a concerted\nand coordinated effort to effect real change, including\nin the United Nations system, that would lead to a more\npeaceful, just and equitable world.\nNo part of the world is in need of positive change\nmore than the African continent, which remains\nmarginalized and almost voiceless. And yet Africa is\na continent of massive potential, and there are already\nunmistakable, if tentative, signs of its awakening. A\nnumber of African countries are taking serious steps\nin the economic, political and social arenas and the\nrevitalization of the African Union proceeds apace.\nWe hope that this African initiative, which will have a\nsalutary effect on the world economy and international\ngovernance, will be supported by a more conducive\ninternational environment and by the United Nations.\nEritrea is convinced that our subregion, the Horn\nof Africa, will overcome its current difficulties and\nmake a substantial contribution to the re-emergence\nof a dynamic and prosperous Africa. Despite the\ndifficulties it has faced, it has made remarkable progress\nin providing and caring for its people and rebuilding\nits economy, and has embarked on modernizing its\ninfrastructure, including developing renewable energy,\nwith the perspective of regional trade, investment and\nintegration. It will continue to work to ensure a life of\ndignity and prosperity for its citizens, in a peaceful and\ncooperative region, and a more just and equitable world.", "meta": {"doc_id": "ERI_67_2012", "year": 2012}, "spans": [{"start": 112, "end": 118, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 21, "token_end": 22}]}
{"text": "On behalf of the people and Government of Honduras I should like most \nsincerely to congratulate you, Sir, on your fitting election as \nPresident of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. I \nwould likewise express our gratitude to your distinguished \npredecessor, Mr. Kittani, who in the discharge of his duties, in a \nparticularly difficult year, demonstrated great ability, firmness and \ndiplomatic tact. As a Latin American I am also very happy to greet \nMr. Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary General, who, with the valuable \ncooperation of a Secretariat dedicated to the lofty ideals of the \nOrganization, has given dynamic direction and impetus to the many \nactivities that have been entrusted to him.\nThe creation of the United Nations inspired great hope among the \npeoples of the world. The Organization established the instruments of \npeace and cooperation that were needed to help a world that had been \nafflicted by war. Although the ideological rivalry of the super \nPowers soon paralyzed valuable initiatives and on many occasions \nbrought us to the brink of war, it is nevertheless true that the \nUnited Nations, as a forum for open discussion, made it possible for \nmankind to survive. There have been many important achievements over \nthe years, but we are now once again living in an era that requires \nMember States to make a conscious effort to strengthen the role of \nthe United Nations and its main bodies in the quest for international \npeace and security.\nToday's world weighs heavily on our conscience. Endless conflicts \npersist without a proper solution, including recent conflicts, as \nwell as internal and international tensions in various parts of the \nworld, which make it difficult to view the future as sounder and more \nsecure. Along with this disquieting situation, we have witnessed a \ntremendous growth of the power of destruction of conventional and \nother weapons in a frenzied arms race.\n\nThe world situation appears even bleaker when we realize with great \nconcern that the means of preventing or solving conflicts are \ninadequate, haphazard and slow and, what is even worse, are \ndisregarded or ignored by some States or rendered ineffective because \nof the obstacles created by attempts to achieve power.\n4\nThe fragile nature of the present international structure shows that, \nin the face of the threats to international peace and security, we \nmust display good sense and fulfil our basic responsibility towards \nmankind by making every effort to foster and strengthen procedures \nfor the prevention and solution of international conflicts. There is \nno doubt that this task must be undertaken on at least two levels: \nfirst, by the member States of the international community, and, \nsecondly, by global and regional international organizations.\nIn the first instance, individual States must display a political \nwill for peace in order to solve their conflicts and must lend their \nsupport to ensure that neighboring or friendly countries involved in \nan international crisis situation achieve a peaceful solution; they \nmust help in the implementation of resolutions adopted by various \ninternational bodies aimed at the settlement of conflicts between \nStates and abide by the decisions of international organizations.\nIn the second instance, we must make an effort to strengthen and \nimprove the means of obtaining peaceful solutions already available \nto all States Members of the United Nations, while at same time \ntrying to find new and imaginative formulas that will contribute to \nthe prevention and settlement of conflicts.\nMy country has at past sessions of the General Assembly emphasized \nthat the future of mankind depends upon real possibilities for \neffective negotiation and consultation to deal with conflicting \ninternational interests. I must therefore at this time express the \nstrongest support of the people and Government of Honduras for the \ncourageous initiative of the Secretary General in his report on the \nwork of the Organization, concerning the strengthening of the role of \nthe Organization for the sake of peace. Honduras congratulates the \nSecretary General on his timely report, and calls upon all Member \nStates to pledge themselves to the honorable mission of revitalizing \nthe juridical, institutional and diplomatic means available to the \nOrganization fully to implement the principles, goals and objectives \nlaid down in the San Francisco Charter.\nTo follow our words with deeds and translate our thoughts into \naction, Honduras has taken an audacious step to help bring about \npeace in Central America, particularly since the election of the new \nconstitutional and democratic Government of Roberto Suazo Cordova. \nThis pacifist tradition is deeply rooted in our history and in the \nconscience of our people. Honduras is the central country of our \nregion, having borders with El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. The \nwaters of the Atlantic and the Pacific bathe our shores.\nIn the nineteenth century and part of the twentieth century, Honduras \nsuffered the adverse consequences of its geographic position and its \nsoil was used as a battleground in the disputes of opposing political \nfactions in neighboring countries or conflicts between States. These \npolitical upheavals in Central America deeply affected the Honduran \npopulation and the ensuing internal wars caused grief and \ndestruction. Fortunately, the experiences of our history to which I \nhave referred helped us to overcome these problems and the Honduran \nnation emerged strengthened and we were enabled to substitute \ncivilized, democratic, political dialogue for confrontation.\nThe manner in which our economic structures developed helped us avoid \nthe establishment of a dominant class possessing most of the national \nwealth. The main items we produce fell to the monopoly of foreign \ninterests, particularly as regards export, and drained our country of \ncapital. Consequently the economic disparities which exist in \nHonduras have not resulted in an unbridgeable gap between the \ndifferent sectors of our society. We have no hegemonic oligarchies, \nno indigenous aristocracy. It is therefore not surprising that those \nwho have achieved economic, professional or political success are \noften people of humble extraction, who have learned and succeeded \nthrough hard work.\nThese harsh conditions are reflected in various actions taken \nrecently. No one is unaware of the fact that the countries which have \nsuffered most acutely from the impact of recession, are, like ours, \ncountries of the American continent which lack energy resources. \nNevertheless, Honduras has made an enormous internal effort to \nreadjust its economy and to meet fully all its economic and financial \ncommitments, which has enabled us to protect the stability of our \ncurrency and the image of a country which takes seriously its \nresponsibilities vis a vis the international economic community.\nIn the social field, we are proud of our free, strong and pluralistic \ntrade union movement. Our farmers have been organized for more than \ntwo decades and the various farmers' associations and unions have \nmore than 100,000 members. We also have numerous professional \norganizations of technical experts and craftsmen, and people involved \nin small , medium  and large scale industry, as well as associations \nof students, teachers, businessmen, farm workers, cattlemen, and \nothers. Four political parties represent different trends of thought \nin our legislative system and people of all walks of life are members \nof our judicial system. For more than 30 years we have had labor laws \nto protect our workers and for 20 years we have had a process of \nagrarian reform and a system of social security. The freedom of the \npress is unlimited and fundamental human rights are fully protected.\nIn saying this I do not imply that we have solved all our problems; \nfar from it. I am merely saying that we live in a society governed by \nthe law, that there is a plurality of interests which find expression \nin the framework of freedom, and there are more things uniting us \nthan there are separating us. We live in a society which is open to \npeaceful change and dedicated to the improvement of its democratic \ninstitutions.\nThe political, economic and social development of Honduras has \ncreated a reality which is unique in the Central American region. \nDespite many short, comings in social services in the field of health,\neducation, housing, nutrition and other areas, the Honduran nation \nhas achieved high standards in certain fundamental areas which enable \nus to look with optimism.\nThe Hondurans embrace the creed of peace through justice, and justice \nthrough freedom. Hence, those who are familiar with our people know \nthat we reject violence in all its forms. More than any other Central \nAmerican people, Hondurans practice dialogue in the settlement of \ntheir disputes. We support the electoral process for the \nestablishment of a government, in the belief that there is support in \nour society for all political sectors involved in running the affairs \nof our community.\nThese values of the Honduran nation were reaffirmed in the re \nestablishment of democracy which began in 1980, when the people were \ncalled upon to elect a National Constituent Assembly, and 84 per cent \nof the electoral population of Honduras went to the polls. Not even \ncountries with the oldest democratic tradition can boast such \nvigorous popular participation. There is no doubt that this \noverwhelming expression of the sovereignty of the people is an \noutstanding example for the future of our country and of Central \nAmerica.\nOne year later, in 1981, the Honduran people demonstrated even more \nvigorously their confidence in the free electoral process. Observers \nfrom almost all parts of the world witnessed a new, exemplary, civic \nevent, namely the establishment of the political and legal system \nwhich now governs the destiny of our country.\nThe Honduran people, on the basis of its sovereignty, calls for a \nreturn to a climate of political understanding, social peace and \nrespect for human dignity, at a time when we are witnessing in our \nregion the tragedy of violence and social upheavals.The situation in \nmy country is in stark contrast with the abolition in other States of \nthe region of individual and public freedoms and the denial of the \npeoples' right to self determination.\nFor these reasons, the democratic process which began in Honduras so \nsuccessfully undoubtedly represents renewed hopes for peace and \nfreedom which are bound to exert a positive influence in our \ntormented Central America.\nHonduras, its people and its Government, are fully aware of the \ncircumstances which threaten peace at home and abroad. They are \nequally aware of their role in the current situation in the region. \nThe President of my country, Mr. Roberto Suazo Cordova, upon coming \nto power, stated that Honduras did not want to become the arbiter of \nthe region and its anguish, its hopes and its expectations, for that \nis not its function. But Honduras ardently desires to help bring \nabout stability and harmony, in keeping with its devotion to the \nprinciples of non intervention and self determination, and to help \nCentral America to become a region of peaceful coexistence, whose \npeople and leaders will establish and maintain understanding on the \nbasis of effective dialogue. The President of Honduras wants Central \nAmerica to be a zone of peace, not to see it tormented by bellicose \ndisputes and polarizing confrontations. In that vein, the foreign \npolicy of Honduras is based on the simple but preeminent principle of \nthe internationalization of peace in that troubled region of our \ncontinent.\nBased on our desire to adopt concrete measures in Central America to \nrelieve the tension and dispel the violence of irreparable \nconsequences, Honduras has presented a peace initiative which has \nreceived broad national and international support. It consists of six \npoints which, in the view of my Government, cover the main questions \nto be discussed. This, however, does not exclude the possibility of \nconsidering others aimed at the same goal of achieving peace in the \nregion, which may come from other States equally interested in \nachieving the same goal. Honduras has proposed the following six \npoints.\nFirst, we propose that the bases for general disarmament in the \nregion be immediately established. This would imply not only a halt \nof the arms race which has created so much tension and instability in \nCentral America and in continental relations, but a real reduction of \nmilitary equipment and manpower to ensure that countries possessing \narmed forces maintain them at the level strictly necessary for the \ndefense of their territorial integrity and sovereignty and the \nmaintenance of public order, and that they abide by the universally \nestablished criteria recognized by every democratic society based on \nthe rule of law. There should also be agreements on the types of \nweapons whose limitation on proscription would be determined in this \ngeneral disarmament plan.\nSecondly, we propose that agreement likewise be reached on an \nobjective and reasonable reduction in the number of foreign military \nand other advisers, or any other elements which are liable to cause \nconcern or unrest, or undermine the identity of any nation.\nThirdly, we propose that there be a survey of and agreement on the \nrequired machinery to ensure, by means of international supervision \nand monitoring, to which Honduras will submit, that countries of the \nCentral American region fulfill their commitments and \nresponsibilities. This system of supervision and monitoring would be \napplied to countries where there exist conflicts and difficult \nsituations likely to affect peace in the region, especially in ports, \nairports, borders and strategic areas. My country is ready to open \nits territory without any reservations to any form of international \nsupervision for the purpose of achieving and maintaining peace.\nFourthly, we propose that there be consideration of and agreement on \nthe most appropriate procedures and mechanisms to put an end to the \ntraffic of arms in the region.\nFifthly, we propose that recognized boundaries and the traditional \nlines of jurisdiction of the States of the region be fully respected \nso as not to endanger peace through new disputes which might arise \nwith regard to land or sea.\nSixthly, we propose that a set of guidelines be drawn up for a \npermanent multilateral dialogue on the basis of this initiative, thus \nto promote political understanding internally, to achieve a \ndemocratic and pluralistic system and assure respect for public \nfreedoms and the right of the peoples to express their will freely.\nWe affirm that the arms race constitutes an inherent threat to the \nfuture of nations and the survival of mankind itself. We therefore \nbelieve that the excessive expenditures in war equipment should be \nused to combat poverty and misery and to promote the well  being of \nthe people, to lend technical and scientific assistance, to overcome \nconditions of backwardness facing developing countries and to help in \nthe establishment of a new international economic order so as to \nreduce the tensions that aggravate the tragic problems of our times.\nThis is the struggle that we are engaged in to achieve domestic as \nwell as international peace; but I must state clearly and \nunequivocally that we have fallen victim to certain problems which \nstem from the internal problems of neighboring nations which are \nthreatening our own security now. Honduras is being threatened by \nterrorism in which the direct participation of outside elements has \nbeen demonstrated, and which undermines fundamental human rights and \nattempts to undo the entire democratic process which we are building. \nThe recent acts of terrorism have been denounced by our people who \nmost energetically reject violence as a means of political action \nwhose sole purpose is to destroy social peace and jeopardize human \ndignity.\nThe Honduran people want to live in peace, work in peace, build in \npeace, bring about change in peace and know that the road of peace \nwas built to be used for peace in this democracy in which we live \ntoday.\nThe Government of Honduras expresses the hope that the international \ncommunity, represented in the Organization, will devise and adopt \nmultilateral legal instruments which will eradicate the underlying \ncauses of terrorism and will fight and impose sanctions on this \ndreadful scourge, one which offends the conscience of civilized \nnations and of the peoples who strive to build a better future based \non peaceful coexistence, understanding and solidarity.\nHonduras wants to devote all of its strength to the consolidation of \npolitical democracy and economic and social development. We want and \nneed a climate of peace and security, stability and harmony, to \nstrive to overcome the present economic crises in our country and at \nthe same time achieve social justice by means of peaceful change. We \nwould like to devote our limited material resources to combat poverty \nand promote the well being of our people rather than to compete in a \nruinous arms race. We do not want an armed peace for Central America, \nnor a balance of power based on the possession of sophisticated \nweapons of destruction.\nHonduras extends its hand to the countries that are ready to \nassociate themselves with this effort for peace with justice and \nfreedom.\nTogether with Costa Rica, Honduras has endeavored to find formulas to \nsolve the conflicts in Central America peacefully and democratically. \nA meeting of foreign ministers of several Central American and \nCaribbean countries was held in San Jose on 4 October last, to \nconsider ways and means truly and effectively to achieve these goals. \nA particularly significant issue was the establishment of a forum for \npeace and democracy with a mandate to carry out the peace initiatives \nbased on agreements between States of the region.\nThis meeting of democratic countries emphasized the need to help \nestablish peace in the region, to promote and. consolidate a \ncomprehensive system of institutions in the countries of the region \nand to create an appropriate scheme for intra regional and \ninternational cooperation in various fields on the basis of peace, \nsecurity, democracy and development.\nTins new vigorous effort is made in the context of the Honduran peace \nproposal, sincemultilateral dialogue on a permanent basis is the \nfundamental requirement for the achievement of appropriate and \nlasting solutions We would like to express the hope that the \nGovernment of Nicaragua will support this new initiative and the \nprinciples which have inspired it, for we believe that a Nicaragua \nwhich will establish and guide its revolutionary process along the \npath of democracy, pluralism and non alignment is essential for the \npolitical stability and the peace and security of the Central \nAmerican region.\nThe Secretary General asked me today, without prejudice to other \nongoing initiatives, to meet at Headquarters with the Foreign \nMinister of Nicaragua. I have accepted this fraternal invitation of \nthe Secretary General to demonstrate quite clearly once again, in \nthis Hall where we gather in the pursuit of peace, justice and \ncooperation, the unswerving desire of the Government of Honduras to \nhold a dialogue for a global exchange of views on the problems which \naffect the Central American region.\nI have tried to explain in plain and simple terms what Honduras \nconsists of and what its contribution is to the cause of peace in \nCentral America. The international community will judge us on the \nbasis of our actions. Before I refer to other matters in the general \ndebate, I should simply like to repeat, with all the strength that my \nGovernment is capable of demonstrating, that we shall continue to \nconduct our affairs in accordance with the principles of \nnonintervention, respect for the right to self determination of \npeoples, the territorial integrity of every State and, especially, \nour respect for the us^ of peaceful means to solve disputes. I am \nsimply emphasizing the words of the President of Honduras, Roberto \nSuazo Cordova, who, addressing himself recently to the Presidents of \nMexico and Venezuela, affirmed that The Honduran people will never \nresort to aggression or threats against any of our neighbors because \nwe firmly believe that any dispute between States can be settled \npeacefully.\nMy Government trusts that all Central American States will identify \nwith this postulate and that, setting aside claims of supremacy and \ndangerous ideological confrontations which are alien to our spirit, \nour destiny and our history, a free and democratic Central America \nwill see its efforts crowned with peace.\nThere are many political, economic and social issues on the agenda of \nthe General Assembly on which we should like to express our objective \nviews which guide us. in our participation in the work of cooperation \nthat motivates the United Nations. Our country will continue to make \nits enthusiastic contribution to the Group of 77, over which we have \npresided on two occasions in various forums. Honduras will also be \npresent as an observer in the meetings of the non aligned movement, \naware that, in political and economic matters, both groups agree on \nprinciples of justice in keeping with the growing aspirations of the \ndeveloping world.\nThe climate of mistrust and underlying hostility between the major \npolitical and military blocs of East and West this year have darkened \nthe picture. The limited achievements of the second special session \nof the General Assembly devoted to disarmament is an eloquent \nstatement on the real intentions which seem to guide the super Powers \nat this time.\nThe principles of international law enshrined in the Charter have \ncontinued to be ignored in various situations, sacrificed to the most \nblatant form of power politics, and the Security Council has been \nparalyzed during grave conflicts because of a total lack of agreement \non the objectives and the actions to which it could have legitimately \ncommitted itself.\nThis atmosphere of tension and lack of effectiveness has further \ncomplicated the solution of problems which are within the competence \nof the Security Council, thus prolonging existing conflicts and \nfailing to avoid the emergence of new crises and international \nconfrontations.\nIn the Middle East, conflicts have worsened. Hence, in the past few \nmonths we have witnessed the invasion of Lebanese territory by the armed \nforces of Israel, which, engaging in heavy fighting with Syrian and \nPalestinian military units, have occupied part of that territory and \nfor several weeks encircled its capital, Beirut, causing destruction, \ndesolation and death. This tragic situation was further aggravated by \nthe massacre of refugees, which caused indignation in the \ninternational community and deeply moved the Honduran people. My \nGovernment, which is attached to the values of respect for the human \nperson, most vigorously condemns this tragic holocaust.\nThe Honduran Government firmly condemns the use of force in the \nsettlement of international conflicts and rejects with equal vigor \nthe corollary that the acquisition of territories by occupation can \nbe justified.\nSimilarly, our Government believes that the legitimate rights of the \nPalestinian people to have their own homeland should be achieved \nthrough serious comprehensive negotiations and the open and firm \nsupport of the international community.\nThe right of Israel to exist and live in peace with its neighbors \nwithin secure and recognized boundaries, which Honduras has always \nsupported, can and must be coupled with the rights of the Palestinian \npeople to self determination and the establishment of their own State.\nIn southern Africa, the hopes raised five years ago by the plan of \nWestern Powers for Namibia, supplemented by the Security Council, \nhave given way to profound disillusionment, creating a dangerous \nclimate which could lead to new acts of aggression. In our view, \nthere is no other way but to persist in achieving the holding of free \nelections in Namibia as soon as possible and, therefore, we lend our \nsupport to fresh negotiations to put an end to the illegal occupation \nof the Territory by South Africa.\nThe world problems to which we referred earlier cannot conceal the \nimportant fact that conflicts emerge and develop basically in a \nregional context and that according to the letter and spirit of the \nCharter it is first and foremost for the members of each region and \nregional machinery they have established to solve conflicts with a \nfull sense of responsibility.\nBecause of its global character, the process of decolonization must \nbe in conformity with the peculiarities of history and geography. \nThus, in our American continent, a problem at once colonial and \nregional has been deeply felt recently by our peoples. We refer to \nthe colonial situation of the Malvinas and the grave crisis and armed \nconfrontation of last April and May between the Republic of Argentina \nand the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nHonduras recognizes the sovereign rights of the Republic of Argentina \nover the Malvinas and supports its claim. Honduras believes that \nevery conflict between States can be settled by negotiation; \ntherefore, it rejects the use of force in any international conflict. \nHonduras is in favor of a speedy negotiated solution between the \nparties which would give sovereignty over the Malvinas to Argentina.\nOur people is united in the quest for material and spiritual \nadvancement and the consolidation of Honduran nationhood through \nsound institutions based on justice, freedom and national harmony.\nWe are also united with regard to external matters. It is not a mere \nwhim to insist on peace; nor is it Utopia. Men of good will and \ngenerous thought know how to achieve it. Leaders who forget that the \nsupreme mandate is to secure the well  being of those they govern \nthrough respect for their dignity and the practice of harmonious \ncoexistence, will inescapably be drawn to the exercise of tyranny \nwhich is doomed to failure. The lessons of history are many and \nHonduras has learned from them. We have chosen to take the \nencouraging and promising road of democracy and peace.\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "HND_37_1982", "year": 1982}, "spans": [{"start": 42, "end": 50, "label": "GPE",

{"text": "I would first like to convey the deepest sympathies of the people and the Government of Pakistan to the people of Mexico, who have been affected by the recent earthquake, and all of those affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\nLet me then congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. I am confident that your long experience in public service and international relations will be an asset in successfully guiding the Assembly to address the imposing challenge of security, development and governance that confront the world today.\nFor over 70 years, despite the Cold War, the nuclear arms race and scores of regional conflicts, our world has been able to avoid a global conflagration. That can be ascribed largely to the adherence by most States to the prohibition of the use or threat of use of force, except under the authority of the Charter of the United Nations.\nUnfortunately, the principles of the Charter of the United Nations have been progressively eroded in the new millennium. In recent years, some countries have displayed a growing proclivity to resort to unilateral force and intervention against other States. Coercion and threats have emerged once again as the main currency in the management of inter-State disputes and differences. Renewed East-West tensions may engulf Europe in another Cold War. Peace and prosperity in Asia are threatened by emerging great Power friction and rising tensions in South, East and West Asia.\nThe Middle East is racked by war and violence in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere. Although Da\u2019esh appears to have been weakened in Iraq and Syria, terrorist violence has spread and intensified across the Middle East and Africa and other parts of the world. There is no end in sight to the tragedy of Palestine. Israel\u2019s prolonged occupation and the expansion of illegal settlements may lead to renewed and wider violence in the holy land.\nThe legitimate struggle for self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir continues to be brutally suppressed by India\u2019s occupation forces. Rising racism and religious hatred, manifested in xenophobia and Islamophobia, is erecting physical walls and psychological barriers among nations and peoples, even as our world becomes increasingly interdependent.\nThe ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas is not just an affront to all norms of humanity but also challenges our collective conscience.\nWhile the pillars of world order are being eroded, the imperative of international cooperation \u2014 the need to address poverty, disease, climate change, nuclear proliferation, terrorism and forced displacement \u2014 is intensifying. Today, more than ever, we need the United Nations to provide the parameters, processes and platforms for global cooperation, which is essential if we are to address the wide-ranging challenges to peace, security and development.\nPakistan welcomes the efforts launched by Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to revitalize the United Nations capabilities in peace and security, development and management. We are also committed to a reform that transforms the Security Council into a more representative, democratic and accountable organ, rather than an expanded club of the powerful and the privileged.\nPakistan celebrated the seventieth anniversary of its independence last month. This month marks the seventieth anniversary of Pakistan\u2019s membership in the United Nations. Pakistan\u2019s commitment to the principles of the United Nations is evident from the long record of its constructive role in the initiatives and contributions that have shaped the decisions and discourse at the world Organization with regard to decolonization, development, trade, international law, human rights, refugees, peacekeeping, security, disarmament and United Nations budget and management.\nPakistan has consistently been one of the world\u2019s top troop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping. We will remain on the front lines of peacekeeping and continue to offer professional and well-trained personnel to the United Nations, despite our own security challenges.\nOur adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations flows from the declaration of our founding father, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who said that our foreign policy was one of friendliness and goodwill towards all nations of the world.\nUnfortunately, from day one of its creation, Pakistan has faced unremitting hostility from its eastern neighbour. India refuses to implement the unanimous resolutions of the Security Council, which mandate a United Nations-supervised plebiscite to enable the\n8/42 17-29597 people of Jammu and Kashmir to freely decide their destiny. Instead, India has deployed nearly 700,000 troops in occupied Kashmir to suppress the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiris to exercise their right to self- determination. That represents the most intense foreign military occupation in recent history. As in the past, the Kashmiri people today are waging a heroic and popular struggle to rid themselves of India\u2019s oppressive rule. They come out in the streets daily to call on India to leave Jammu and Kashmir.\nIndia has responded with massive and indiscriminate force to suppress the Kashmiris, shooting indiscriminately at children, women and youth. Hundreds of innocent Kashmiris have been killed or injured, and shotgun pellets have blinded and maimed thousands of Kashmiris, including children. Those and other brutalities clearly constitute war crimes and violate the Geneva Conventions.\nPakistan demands that an international investigation be conducted into India\u2019s crimes in occupied Kashmir. We ask that the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights send an inquiry commission to occupied Kashmir to verify the nature and extent of India\u2019s human rights violations, secure the punishment of those responsible and provide justice and relief to the victims.\nPakistan also urges the international community to call on India to halt pellet-gun attacks and other violence against unarmed demonstrators, stop the use of rape as an instrument of State policy, end media blackouts, rescind its draconian emergency laws and free all Kashmiri political leaders. To divert the world\u2019s attention from its brutalities, India frequently violates the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Kashmir. Despite more than 600 violations since January, Pakistan has acted with restraint, but if India ventures across the Line of Control, or acts upon its doctrine of limited war against Pakistan, it will elicit a strong and matching response. The international community must act decisively to prevent the situation from turning into a dangerous escalation.\nThe Kashmir dispute should be resolved justly, peacefully and expeditiously. As India is unwilling to resume the peace process with Pakistan, we call on the Security Council to fulfil its obligation to secure the implementation of its resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir. To that end, the Secretary-General should appoint a Special Envoy for Jammu and Kashmir.\nHis mandate should flow from the long-standing but unimplemented relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\nLet me reiterate that Pakistan remains open to resuming a comprehensive dialogue with India aimed at addressing all outstanding issues, especially Jammu and Kashmir, and discussing measures to maintain peace and security. That dialogue must be accompanied by an end to India\u2019s campaign of subversion and State-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan, including from across our western border.\nApart from the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan and its people have suffered the most from four decades of foreign intervention and civil wars in Afghanistan. Those wars have blighted our country with the flow of extremists and terrorists, guns and drugs, as well as an influx of millions of refugees. They have set back our economic development by decades. Even today, Pakistan is host to more than 3 million Afghan refugees. No one desires peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. From the 16 years of ongoing war in Afghanistan, it is clear that peace will not be restored by resorting continuously to military force. Kabul, the Coalition and the Afghan Taliban cannot impose a military solution on one another. The international community \u2014 as expressed in several United Nations resolutions \u2014 has concluded that peace can be restored in Afghanistan only through a negotiated settlement.\nHaving suffered and sacrificed so much owing to its role in the global counter-terrorism campaign, Pakistan finds it especially galling to be blamed for the military or political stalemate in Afghanistan. We are not prepared to be anyone\u2019s scapegoat. Taliban safe havens are located not in Pakistan but in the large tracts of territory controlled by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yes, cross-border attacks do occur. They are mostly conducted by anti-Pakistan terrorists from safe havens across the border. In order to end all cross-border attacks, we ask the Afghan Government and the Coalition to support and complement Pakistan\u2019s ongoing efforts to strengthen border controls and monitor all movement across it.\nWhat Pakistan is not prepared to do is to fight the Afghan war on Pakistan\u2019s soil, nor can we endorse any failed strategy that will prolong and intensify the suffering of the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries of the region. Pakistan believes that the urgent and realistic goals in Afghanistan should be: first, to make a concerted effort to eliminate the presence in Afghanistan of Da\u2019esh, Al-Qaida and their affiliates, including the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which was recently declared a terrorist organization by the Security Council; and, secondly, to encourage negotiations between Kabul and the Afghan Taliban \u2014 within the framework of the Quadrilateral Coordination Group or any other trilateral format \u2014 to reach a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan. Those two steps offer the most realistic prospect of restoring peace and stability in Afghanistan and our region.\nPakistan\u2019s counter-terrorism credentials cannot be questioned. Following the 9/11 attack on the United States in 2001, it was Pakistani efforts that enabled the decimation of Al-Qaida. Pakistan\u2019s military campaigns have succeeded in clearing our tribal areas of almost all militant groups. We took the war to the terrorists. We have paid a heavy price. More than 27,000 Pakistanis, including 6,500 military and law-enforcement personnel, have been martyred by terrorists. Some 50,000 Pakistani nationals have been injured, including 15,000 army personnel, many of whom have lost limbs.\nWe have fought the war against terror with our own resources. Pakistan\u2019s economic losses are estimated at more than $120 billion. Yet we remain fully committed to implementing our national action plan against terrorism and extremism. Defeating terrorist violence is vital to realizing our overriding priority of rapid economic and social development.\nTerrorism is now a global phenomenon that must be addressed comprehensively. We see two major gaps in the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\nFirst, the international community has failed to address the issue of State-sponsored terrorism. That is the instrument of choice of the agents of chaos and aspiring hegemons. In several regions, stability will be difficult to restore unless State-sponsored terrorism is condemned, prohibited and punished.\nSecondly, in order to eliminate terrorism, its root causes must be addressed, which go beyond poverty and ignorance. Terrorism is rather an extreme response to real or perceived political and/or other grievances, including foreign intervention, oppression and injustice. Unless such root causes are addressed, it will be difficult to counter the twisted narratives of terrorist groups. Confronted by a hostile and increasingly militarized neighbour, Pakistan has been obliged to maintain its capability for credible deterrence. My country developed nuclear weapons only when they were introduced in our region by that neighbour. Our strategic assets are vital in order to deter the frequent threat of aggression. They are tightly and effectively controlled, as has been widely acknowledged by experts. The world community would be well served by enabling Pakistan to join global non-proliferation arrangements, such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group, on a non-discriminatory basis.\nClimate change poses a new and existential threat to humankind\u2019s future. Extreme climate events are multiplying. Their consequences, such as the flooding in Texas, the landslides in Nepal and Sierra Leone, the devastation wrought by hurricanes in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico, and the disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers, are global and indiscriminate. As one of the States most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Pakistan believes that it is in our collective interest to pursue and realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and build a new and greener model for growth and development.\nGrowth and development remain the primary goals of developing countries. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals represent the most ambitious development agenda in history. The development challenge has become even more difficult owing to the combined constraints of climate change, increasing protectionism, the deterioration of international cooperation and the proliferation of conflicts. The vision of shared growth spelled out in Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative offers a solid path to prosperity and a model of South- South cooperation worthy of emulation.\nPakistan\u2019s economy has recorded a remarkable revival over the past four years. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor will further contribute to our economic upsurge. That will expand exponentially as the Pakistan-China partnership extends beyond energy and transportation to many other sectors. Pakistan\u2019s integration into the Eurasian Belt and Road Initiative will provide a firm foundation for Pakistan\u2019s rapid economic development. With a youthful population of 207 million people, we are confident that an economic strategy anchored in rising incomes, consumption and production will propel Pakistan towards greater prosperity. To achieve those priority goals for our people, Pakistan seeks to build peace within our country and security around our borders. We seek good relations with all States on the basis of sovereign equality. We will respond positively to all offers of friendship and cooperation.\nWe are poised at a critical inflection point in history. The world order that has prevented a global war for more than 70 years is under threat. Yet revolutionary advances in science and technology, the immense capacity for global investment, production, consumption and trade, especially in the developing countries, and the availability of structures and mechanisms for collective action offer an opportunity, unprecedented in human history, to address the diverse challenges that we face today. It is here, through the United Nations, that the peoples of the world can seize the opportunities to achieve our shared vision of a more just, peaceful and prosperous world.", "meta": {"doc_id":

{"text": "This year, once again, the United Nations calls upon all the countries on planet Earth to participate in the General Assembly, which is \u2014 one could say \u2014 a kind of global Parliament. Once again this year, we have the chance to take stock of the advances and setbacks that we have experienced in this large joint enterprise aimed at promoting peace, security and the respect of human rights. Once again this year, we are here to be critical, demanding and\nself-demanding, and to reflect on the need to renew and improve the system of the United Nations.\nHowever, the fact that I can say \u201conce again this year\u201d represents, in itself, a success. Beyond the good decisions and the not-so-good ones made over the years, the mere fact that almost 200 sovereign States symbolically renew their commitment to the United Nations each year is a reason for hope for those of us who, like the people of Andorra, firmly believe in multilateralism and the need to promote peace, security and justice.\nThroughout its more than seven decades of existence, the United Nations has not been a passive stakeholder or a static feature. Quite the contrary, it has managed to extend its mission, make its objectives more ambitious and give them content with tangible results. The United Nations was created to promote peace, security and human rights. However, year after year, it has spread its area of action to become what we see today, that is, a large Assembly of all the countries on planet Earth, which seek to resolve what affects all of us domestically and among all of us.\nThe past 12 months have been highly constructive with regard to advances in the multilateral area. Just one year ago, in September 2015, we unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals listed in what is known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A few months later, the international community \u2014 thanks to the driving force and leadership of the French Republic and our colleague Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2014 demonstrated its ability to give shape and content to the Goals with the drafting and signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nFollowing in the wake of the United Nations, Andorra dedicated this year\u2019s programme at its Summer University to the Sustainable Development Goals as specified in the 2030 Agenda. For one week, Andorra la Vella, our capital, was home to the reflections and debates of experts, as well as institutional representatives, such as the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe and two Under-Secretaries-General of the United Nations.\nThe Andorra Summer University marks the beginning of the academic year in our country, following the summer break. This year, the people of Andorra started the academic year by confirming and demonstrating our commitment to the values of multilateralism and international cooperation. We have done so by adding our own particular accent, placing emphasis on education. We therefore chose the Summer University as the setting for Andorra to show its commitment to the 2030 Agenda.\nAll the Sustainable Development Goals share the same priority. However, Goal 4, on quality education is doubly important. On the one hand, it is an objective in and of itself that has a direct link to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. But it is also a means to achieve the rest of the Goals. At the time of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the General Assembly warned about the need to detail the Goals in their specific implementation and seek the involvement of all stakeholders \u2014 not just public institutions \u2014 in that ambitious enterprise. Therefore, global involvement, including on the part of individuals, local institutions and large supranational organizations, requires a key tool, namely, education.\nThe great edifice of the United Nations principles and values is built upon the idea that what affects all of us needs to be solved by all of us and that global matters require coordinated global actions. It is true that a global world needs global institutions, as well as global regulations and global solutions. But the entire architecture will be as fragile as a house of cards if we do not educate new generations to be global citizens. A global world needs global citizens.\nIn striving to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, Andorra is placing its emphasis on education and extending quality education to everyone, not only as a goal in and of itself but also to promote education towards global citizenship. Such citizenship is aware of the challenges and the opportunities in our world, sensitive to the protection of human rights, and open and prepared for the dynamics of our times.\nDuring the past several years, the Government that I head has made education the centre of Andorra\u2019s foreign policy in the multilateral arena. We did so during the Andorran presidency of the Council of Europe for 2012-2013. We did so by joining the Global Education First Initiative, promoted by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We have done so in the contexts of the Ibero-American Community and the International Organization of la Francophonie. We will also do so by making education one of our priorities as members of the Economic and Social Council. We will continue to do so in all multilateral forums dealing with education. However, in keeping with Goal 17 of the 2030 Agenda, we are aware that we need to seek alliances with other countries, joint actions and partnerships between the public and the private sectors.\nAllow me to offer a recent example of Andorran action in the multilateral arena. Two weeks ago, the twenty-fifth Conference of Ministers of Education of Ibero-American countries was held in Andorra. The meeting gave rise to a commitment by the Ibero- American Governments to promote the mobility of all our students. An agreement among the Governments, the Ibero-American Secretary-General, the Organization of Ibero-American States for Education, Science and Culture and the Ibero-American University Board will promote the mobility of university students within the Ibero-American area, which currently has 22 full member States. The aim of the signatories is to offer mobility to 200,000 university students between now and 2020.\nAs always when talking about education, the goal is twofold. On the one hand, the goal is to promote an exchange of experiences, which contributes to improving the quality of our education systems. On the other hand \u2014 and this is probably the most important part \u2014 the goal is to make our young people aware of the fact that their reality and their future do not end at the borders of the country in which they were born, but rather that they are citizens of a global society. To some degree, we are following in the wake of the Erasmus programme for the mobility of university students in Europe. What has done more to promote European construction \u2014 all the regulations and directives that make up the European Union acquis, or all the young people who, for decades, have been completing part of their university courses in other European countries and who feel European?\nIt is not the young people who wish to isolate themselves. And those of us who are here today \u2014 most of whom are from a generation that has left its youth behind \u2014 must be increasingly more generous and more open-minded, because the future of our young people, the future of our countries and the future of our world depends on it. If we educate our young people as citizens of a global world, we will be laying the foundation for a much more open, cooperative and fair world.\nIn line with the theme of this session, \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d, Andorra\u2019s commitment to quality education is not limited to diverse actions in multilateral forums, but also has a local dimension. The local dimension begins as a result of the good fortune \u2014 and it is necessary to say that because it is good fortune \u2014 that we enjoy in having three public systems that are free and available: the Spanish, the French and the Andorran systems. That in itself makes up a pluralist educational community with a marked international component.\nIn that sense, the people of Andorra have been pioneers in our education system in introducing \u201ceducation by skills\u201d, which is a model that seeks to overcome the old concept of education as a simple accumulation of knowledge to focus on education understood as a set of abilities and skills to apply that knowledge. The reason for that model is that what is important is not so much knowing, but thinking; we do not wish to create encyclopaedias, but rather citizens. Citizens who can develop themselves and grow in a world that is changing at great speed and who, when faced with the expected and the unexpected, are able to react appropriately and who are not afraid of changes, dynamism and opening up.\nWe in Andorra have been working on education centred on transversal skills for some years now. And now \u2014 precisely because of the need to educate global citizens \u2014 we wish to go one step further. Andorra, in coordination with the Council of Europe, will introduce training programmes on democratic values and systems, so as to measure the abilities and skills of our young people with regard to such democratic values. Why not think about a global commitment to educating our young children on the principles and values of the United Nations, and more specifically, on the Sustainable Development Goals embodied in the 2030 Agenda? Because in 2030, it will be them, and not us, who will be sitting here in the General Assembly.\nThe great dialectic of our times is not \u2014 as it used to be in the past \u2014 between the right and the left, or the policy of blocs, typical of the Cold War, which we have thankfully left behind. The great dialectic of our time is between being open and being closed, between those who wish for an open, transparent, cooperative and dynamic world with strong multilateral institutions and those who wish for a closed, opaque and static world in which each country looks, only and exclusively, after its own interests.\nThe road to opening up to commitment, negotiation and multilateralism is the path that we have been tracing for decades under the auspices of the United Nations. The path to closing down is a reflection of fear and a recipe for populists and opportunists, who, when faced with an economic crisis of global scope, withdraw into protectionism; when faced with a threat to security of global scope, close their borders; when faced with a challenge such as climate change, adopt the selfish attitude of free riding, or expecting others to make the efforts. The answers of populism are that it is other people\u2019s fault and that we should isolate ourselves from the others. However, in a global society, we are the others.\nI believe that we are all here at the Assembly to renew our confidence in a multilateral way and to continue practicing the maxim that says that global matters require global answers. The Principality of Andorra today reiterates its belief in the multilateral path. Because it is in forums such as the General Assembly that a country like ours, with a surface area of 468 square kilometres and just over 70,000 inhabitants, can be on an equal footing with the rest of the nations on the planet. And I do not mean just rhetorical equality \u2014 we have been participating and getting involved in coordinated, balanced actions that involve the entire international community, and we have been doing so for years.\nWe have demonstrated that, quite adequately in my opinion, by participating with all our efforts to build a more cooperative, transparent and fair global economy. Over the past five years, Andorra has opened its economy to foreign investment, given economic rights to all international residents, set up a comparable tax system following international standards, made progressive advances in matters of exchanging fiscal information, which will culminate next year with the automatic exchange of information within the area of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union, and we have also set up a network of double taxation treaties to internationalize the economic model.\nIn parallel, along with Monaco and San Marino, we are negotiating an association agreement with the European Union that will enable the full participation of Andorra in the European internal market. We have done so not only because we need to modernize and diversify our economy, but also because we are of the firm conviction that a world with more intense economic and commercial relations is by nature a world that cooperates more and is less selfish. It is also a world that is more inclined towards peace, harmony, negotiated solutions to conflicts and respect for human rights and liberties.\nIt was in that same spirit of firm confidence in global action that we participated last year in the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which led to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In the coming weeks, our Parliament will be asked to ratify the Paris Agreement. It is with that same mindset, in our view, that we need to deal with the matter of the huge displacements of refugees and migrants, which have become one of the great challenges of our times. It is a challenge that needs to be dealt with through the regulation, both internationally as well as locally, of migratory flows and the right to asylum, through the fair distribution of the impact that taking in a huge contingent of displaced people may represent, and through care and vigilance to ensure the respect of rights and the dignity of displaced people.\nIn that connection, I am delighted, taking up what I said before regarding the fundamental role of education, that the high-level meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants, which took place here on 19 September, also emphasized the need to construct a positive narrative on immigration. Andorra, which has for decades been a land that has welcomed many families from all over, is a good example of that positive narrative, as is the case, I am sure, for many of the countries represented here. However, in order for that narrative to continue to be valid, we also need to teach the value of respect for diversity. We must raise world citizens who do not fear difference or change.\nWhile populism would prefer protectionism and economic isolation, we opt for liberalization and greater integration of our national economies. While populism would prefer to deny the scientific evidence of climate change and turn its back on the problem, we opt instead for commitments and specific measurable actions. While populism would prefer to close borders, build walls and stoke the fear of difference, we opt instead for the dignity of persons, for regulation and for education about diversity.\nThis is the last session of the General Assembly with Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General. Many speakers have highlighted his career and his wise decisions over the last decade. Mr. Ban Ki-moon is the Secretary-General who brought about the effective implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and was the driving force behind the post-2015 development agenda. He has been a key player in the relaunching of the multilateral strategy in the fight against climate change, which culminated in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. As a legacy of his 10- year mandate, he leaves us with a clearly marked path in the form of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Mr. Ban Ki-moon is therefore a fundamental player in any understanding or explanation of the United Nations, and by extension, of the entire international community during the first third of the twenty-first century.\nFor the people of Andorra, Mr. Ban Ki-moon is also the first Secretary-General to make an official visit to our country, as he did in April 2013. The Andorran people have heeded his teachings well. If education is the guiding thread to a good part of Andorra\u2019s multilateral action, that is also thanks to the insistence of the Secretary-General on making quality universal education one of the main pillars of his action during his 10 years at the helm of the United Nations. As Mr. Ban Ki-moon said during his visit to Andorra three and a half years ago, the United Nations will always be able to count on our country in the collective endeavour to build a more peaceful, secure and, above all, more equitable world.\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "AND_71_2016", "year": 2016}, "spans": [{"start": 643, "end": 649, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 135, "token_end": 136}, {"start": 2498, "end": 2515, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 484, "token_end": 487}, {"start": 4787, "end": 4794, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 906, "token_end": 907}, {"start": 5674, "end": 5688, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1076, "token_end": 1079}, {"start": 5932, "end": 5953, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1123, "token_end": 1127}, {"start": 6023, "end": 6028, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1139, "token_end": 1140}, {"start": 6089, "end": 6103, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1149, "token_end": 1152}, {"start": 7723, "end": 7730, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1474, "token_end": 1475}, {"start": 8055, "end": 8062, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1537, "token_end": 1538}, {"start": 8068, "end": 8074, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1540, "token_end": 1541}, {"start": 9536, "end": 9543, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1813, "token_end": 1814}, {"start": 11128, "end": 11135, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2126, "token_end": 2127}, {"start": 16090, "end": 16098, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3045, "token_end": 3046}, {"start": 16191, "end": 16198, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3064, "token_end": 3065}]}
{"text": "It is a pleasure for me to \naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. Our coming here as leaders gives us the \nopportunity to debate global challenges as per our \nobjectives and goals as enshrined in the United Nations \nCharter. \n The United Nations is a forum where we all come \ntogether to share ideas, review progress and come up \nwith strategies to deal with world issues that need our \nattention and input. The founders of this Organization \nhad a noble idea of addressing world issues amicably \nwith a view to avoiding confrontation. Therefore, we \nare supposed to meet as equal partners to debate issues \nthat affect us as the world community, in a forum \nwhere we are guided by the principles of trust, respect \nand natural justice. The aim of the United Nations is to \nbring joy and peace to the nations of the world. Let us \nmake sure that people develop confidence in the United \nNations so that they can approach the Organization \nwhen they have problems. \n We note that Africa has multiple problems that \nseriously hinder its progress in the areas of health, the \neconomy, poverty and social welfare, which all come \nunder the Millennium Development Goals. It is our aim \nas the African continent to evolve from being third \nworld countries to a first world status. That calls on \nus \u2014 Africa in general and Swaziland in particular \u2014 \nto work harder and smarter in order to realize that goal \nand generate a strong economy for the betterment of \nthe lives of all our peoples. \n However, we realize that we cannot effectively \ndeal with the challenges confronting us alone, mainly \nbecause our resources are limited. It is through the \nUnited Nations that we continue to forge partnerships \nwith different countries so that we work together to \ngrow our economies. We appeal to the developed \nnations to recognize our hard work and to increase our \naccess to soft loans and grants to support development \nprogrammes and poverty-reduction strategies. We call \non the United Nations to continue supporting national \ninitiatives aimed at eventually transforming our \neconomies to first world economies. \n However, the global financial and economic crisis \nhas made the situation difficult, especially for \ndeveloping countries. It restrains us from achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n The secondary effects of the crisis are now hitting \nhard on developing economies, like that of the \n  \n \n09-52470 10 \n \nKingdom of Swaziland, whose export trade is largely \ndependent on performance in developed global \nmarkets. In our case, several Government interventions \nhave been undertaken to rescue sectors such as the pulp \nand textile industries. Added to this is the need to \nmobilize resources and promote financial inclusion in \norder to stimulate economic growth at the grassroots \nlevel. In that regard, financial inclusion remains an \nimportant stimulus for poverty alleviation programmes \nin developing countries like the Kingdom of \nSwaziland.  \n We are encouraged by signs of recovery from the \ncrisis, and we are confident that the United Nations \nwill continue to play its leading role in the efforts to \nfind a speedy resolution to the situation so that we may \nall focus on development issues for the benefit of all \nour peoples. \n It is most unfortunate that while we do our level \nbest to improve our economies, we continue to be \nconfronted by disturbances and conflicts that include \nwars and coups. We condemn those acts, as they lead to \nuntold suffering for millions of our peoples. As nations \nof the world, let us come together and make sure that \nsuch acts are not supported or encouraged. We call \nupon all nations of the world to isolate and discourage \nthe sympathizers and sponsors. Where there are \nproblems, the peoples of the world must know that they \ncan address the challenges that they encounter through \npeaceful engagement and dialogue.  \n If we want to achieve peace in the world, it is \nimportant that we reduce and eventually eradicate \nnuclear arms, which pose a threat to our planet. We \nneed to encourage nations that are at the stage of \ndeveloping, and those that already possess, nuclear \ncapability to utilize it for power generation that \nsupports and stimulates economic growth. Therefore, \nwe encourage the International Atomic Energy Agency \nto continue to monitor countries that are developing \nnuclear arms so that they may be stopped. It must also \nensure that countries that already have nuclear \ncapability reduce and eventually eradicate their nuclear \narms so that they become a thing of the past. In order \nto accelerate the eradication of nuclear arms, the \nUnited Nations must set targets and timelines for \ncompliance. \n Another issue of concern is the continuing delay \nof the reform of the Security Council. Many nations \nhave come to the conclusion that the Council \nmembership needs to be expanded so that it is more \nrepresentative, so that its decisions may be owned by \nall Member States. \n Africa has adopted firm and clear resolutions on \nthe Council composition they would like to see. Those \ndecisions were further affirmed at the recent summit of \nthe Non-Aligned Movement. Regrettably, we still have \nnot seen meaningful progress on that matter. We \ntherefore would like to call on all members of the \nSecurity Council to address that issue with the urgency \nthat it deserves. \n We are encouraged by the call made by fellow \nleaders for us to open a new page in the work of the \nUnited Nations by approaching global matters \ncollectively. It is imperative that the United Nations \ntake the lead in all issues that affect mankind. The \nreform of the Security Council is one such area that \ncould clearly demonstrate the new approach to issues. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland reiterates its support \nfor the efforts deployed by the international community \nunder the auspices of the United Nations towards a \npolitical solution to the issue of Western Sahara. We \nreaffirm that the initiative by the Kingdom of Morocco \nfor considerable autonomy for Western Sahara is the \nbeginning of a realistic and credible move. The \nKingdom of Swaziland calls upon all parties to join the \nprocess in order to implement Security Council \nresolutions 1813 (2008) and 1871 (2009).  \n The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to support \nefforts to bring lasting peace to the situation in the \nDarfur region, Somalia, Madagascar and other parts of \nour continent.  \n I take this opportunity to express my appreciation \nfor the support and assistance being extended to the \nInclusive Government and the people of the Republic \nof Zimbabwe by the nations of the world and by \ninternational organizations. I also wish to echo the call \nand appeal of the Southern African Development \nCommunity for the immediate removal of all sanctions \nagainst Zimbabwe, in order to ensure the speedy \nrecovery of the economy of that country for the benefit \nof its long-suffering people. \n As we gather here, we also wait with anticipation \nfor the outcome of the Israeli and Palestinian peace \nefforts. We have seen the two parties enter into \npromising peace agreements in the past that, \nregrettably, faltered along the way. We call upon the \n \n \n11 09-52470 \n \ntwo parties to continue to pursue peace to avoid loss of \nlife and to live in harmony. \n We are happy to acknowledge the improvements \nin the relations between the Republic of China on \nTaiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China. That new \ndevelopment has resulted in the international \ncommunity responding positively to the request of \nTaiwan to be involved in United Nations agencies, as \nevidenced by the granting of observer status in the \nWorld Health Assembly. We look forward to seeing \nTaiwan being allowed to fully contribute to humanity \nby being given adequate participation in other United \nNations specialized agencies. \n It is encouraging that this year\u2019s General \nAssembly was preceded by the Summit on Climate \nChange, where issues of environmental protection were \ngiven priority, as they are critical to all our \ndevelopment strategies. The Summit noted that some \ndeveloped countries pollute the environment, mainly \nthrough gas emissions, despite all the protocols in \nplace to protect it. \n I am confident that the Summit was able to \nmobilize adequate political support to guide the \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Copenhagen in December, where developed \ncountries will be able to share their experiences and the \nchallenges that they faced. This will inform the agenda \nthat will lead to the transfer of skills and technology so \nthat, as developing countries pursue their growth, they \ncan avoid the mistakes of the past.  \n We cannot overemphasize the need to protect the \nenvironment, as it is a precious gift from God to \nhumanity and must be preserved for generations to \ncome. We support the call for the establishment of a \nmajor fund to cater to all projects related to climate \nchange. We are hopeful that Copenhagen will come up \nwith solutions for funding climate-change projects that \nwill be predictable, accessible and incremental. The \nKingdom of Swaziland is determined to work harder to \nmeet the targets set by the United Nations. \n In conclusion let me say that the Kingdom of \nSwaziland appreciates the good work of the United \nNations and its related agencies, which remain the only \nhope for overcoming the many complex challenges \nfacing the world today. We therefore take pride in \nreaffirming our commitment to the principles and \nideals contained in the United Nations Charter.", "meta": {"doc_id": "SWZ_64_2009", "year": 2009}, "spans": [{"start": 5944, "end": 5958, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1158, "token_end": 1160}, {"start": 6050, "end": 6064, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1177, "token_end": 1179}, {"start": 6389, "end": 6396, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1245, "token_end": 1246}, {"start": 6553, "end": 6562, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1276, "token_end": 1277}, {"start": 6609, "end": 6617, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1286, "token_end": 1287}, {"start": 6823, "end": 6831, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1325, "token_end": 1326}, {"start": 7027, "end": 7034, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1369, "token_end": 1370}, {"start": 7039, "end": 7050, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1371, "token_end": 1372}, {"start": 7404, "end": 7409, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1446, "token_end": 1447}, {"start": 7450, "end": 7455, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1456, "token_end": 1457}]}
