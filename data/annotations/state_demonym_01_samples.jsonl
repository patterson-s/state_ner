{"text": "Mr. President, permit me to associate myself with all the speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum in extending to you, on behalf of the Togolese delegation and on my own behalf, my sincere and warm congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the nineteenth session of the General Assembly, 22.\tMy congratulations are all the more heartfelt in that you are a Ghanaian and I a Togolese, that is to say, in that we are brothers and neighbours."}
{"text": "There can be no doubt that your qualities of heart and mind, your genuine courtesy and your lofty concepts of a united and prosperous Africa were factors that determined the choice of the African Group."}
{"text": "But, as you yourself stressed with such modesty, in the eyes of the Assembly this is not an honour bestowed upon you alone but on Africa as a whole and on the millions of persons of African descent who have been dispersed throughout the world by the vicissitudes of history."}
{"text": "23.\tThis is truly an enhancement of the status of Africa; it is an indication of the recognition and consecration of the newly-regained dignity of the black man, the African Negro."}
{"text": "24.\tIt is scarcely necessary for me to say how happy and proud I am to see, as everyone does, that the skilful manner in which you perform your very delicate task serves to demonstrate to the world the inanity of racial prejudice."}
{"text": "25.\t1 believe that your tact and dedication in dealing with all the problems concerning Africa will help to make the United Nations, by the end of this nineteenth session, which began under the shadow of doubt and discouragement, ever more vigorous and confident in its future."}
{"text": "26.\tIn this connexion, I make an appeal, on behalf of the Togolese delegation, to the two great Powers whose temporary disagreement prevents the Assembly from carrying out its work normally and uselessly detains delegates in New York, thereby entailing very heavy expenses for the African countries."}
{"text": "27.\tThe two great Powers will be truly great only to the extent that they are able to rise above those quarrels of principle and think less of their national prestige and more of the humiliation inflicted on the small Powers as a result of their disagreement."}
{"text": "28.\tI am more than ever convinced that no one would ever accept the terrible responsibility of causing the collapse of an Organization which was born of tears and bloodshed, i.e. amid desolation, but which was built in order to bring about agreement and harmony among States and to promote peace and universal brotherhood through the exchange of ideas."}
{"text": "29.\tMoreover, since nations are composed of men, the Organization concerns itself with man as the essential element of mankind by waging a struggle against hunger, disease, and ignorance."}
{"text": "30.\tThe United Nations thus appears to be the last hope of mankind in this century of confusion and incoherence, of imperialism in its many forms, and of hypocrisy."}
{"text": "Indeed, can anyone kill hope without bringing about his own destruction?"}
{"text": "31.\tIt is not my intention, at this stage in the Assembly's work, to discuss the major problems which confront the world and which call for solution by the United Nations."}
{"text": "32.\tMy Government's policy remains unchanged."}
{"text": "It is based upon three fundamental principles which enable my Government to adopt a clear and logical approach in its international relations."}
{"text": "33.\t"}
{"text": "The fact that we are a small country, that we are under-developed and that we love peace makes it necessary for us to follow a policy of friendship towards all States, without exception, whether they be of the East or of the West."}
{"text": "34.\tMy country is in any case always prepared to vote in favour of the admission to our Organization of all free and independent States, regardless of their political system, since, after all, the aim of the United Nations is to achieve universality."}
{"text": "It is therefore our confident expectation that our brothers who are still suffering under the colonial yoke will soon take their place in the international community."}
{"text": "35.\tThe second principle flows quite naturally from the first."}
{"text": "My Government does not and will not interfere in the internal affairs of any State."}
{"text": "Similarly, it will oppose, by all the means at its disposal, any foreign interference, from whatever quarter, in its own internal affairs."}
{"text": "36.\tIts policy of friendship is directed towards States and not men."}
{"text": "Adopting the old adage that every country has the government which it deserves, my country will refuse to support any initiative, from whatever source, which it regards as interference in the internal affairs of another State."}
{"text": "37.\tSuch an attitude, moreover, is fully in Conformity with one of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the Organization of African Unity the essence of which is contained in its article 3. 38.\t"}
{"text": "The golden rule followed by my Government is a policy of non-interference in the affairs of States and a policy of friendship towards all States."}
{"text": "39.\tSuch a policy, however, does not extend to those nations which have placed themselves beyond the pale of mankind by their vain efforts to keep our African brothers under their yoke."}
{"text": "Those countries should remember that the course of history is irreversible."}
{"text": "40.\tNor does such a policy extend to States in which part of the population, because it happens to be of a certain colour, has the arrogance to practise segregation and impose serfdom on the other part of the population which, owing to the inscrutable ways of providence, is of a different colour."}
{"text": "However, is there really any need for further comment on these anachronistic States?"}
{"text": "41.\t"}
{"text": "The third principle is derived from the first two and imposes upon the Togolese Government a position of neutrality vis-&-vis the two blocs."}
{"text": "Our policy is one of non-alignment and non-interference, but this in no way prevents my delegation from adopting a positive attitude whenever it considers that the cause involved is a just one."}
{"text": "42.\tFinally, Togo, which until yesterday was still a ward of the United Nations and is today a free and independent State deeply committed to the noble ideals of peace and brotherhood among nations, is happy to be part of the irresistible forward movement in which men of ever-increasing similarity are joining, for at the end of the road the unity to be found through universal love is already in sight."}
{"text": "It is a pleasure to join preceding speakers in congratulating Mr. Jan Eliasson on his election as President at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly."}
{"text": "In particular, I welcome the fact that the international community has given him the honour of being elected President of the General Assembly, at its present session at which we are commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization."}
{"text": "Moreover, at the present session we shall, above all, work to implement the commitments undertaken by the heads of State or Government to strengthen United Nations reform and adapt the Organization to the changes on the international stage so that it can remain the forum for coordination and debate, an irreplaceable instrument for conflict prevention and management and the body for upholding international law and the integrity of States."}
{"text": "I also congratulate the President at the fifty-ninth session, Mr. Jean Ping, Minister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and la Francophonie of the Gabonese Republic."}
{"text": "With his great human qualities and his skill as a statesman, he carried out his mission with tact and personal engagement."}
{"text": "Finally, allow me to convey to Secretary-General Kofi Annan the encouragement and the gratitude of Mr. Joseph Kabila, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for his commitment to finding a solution to the crisis in the Great Lakes region and for the importance that he attaches to the protection of the values of human dignity."}
{"text": "Mr. Eliasson is presiding over the General Assembly at a pivotal moment for our Organization."}
{"text": "It would be hard not to make a connection between the history of my country, the President\u2019s mandate and the destiny of an eminent citizen of his country, Sweden, who gained fame in my country for his commitment to the cause of peace."}
{"text": "I am referring to Mr. Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the second Secretary-General of the United Nations."}
{"text": "As the President has assumed his functions in September, it should be recalled that on 20 September 1960, my country became a Member of the United Nations."}
{"text": "And on 18 September 1961, the late Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld gave his life for his commitment to the Democratic Republic of the Congo."}
{"text": "I pay tribute to the memory and the courage of that hero, as well as to the civilian and military members of the United Nations Operation in the Congo who lost their lives alongside our soldiers while defending the sovereignty and the integrity of our territory."}
{"text": "A comparison of the United Nations involvement in the Congo in 1960 and that of the present reveals a number of similarities, including the tireless dedication to the cause of peace demonstrated by the Blue Helmets."}
{"text": "My country has twice benefited from peace operations, and we know the price paid by United Nations forces to save us from disaster."}
{"text": "Our first-hand 31\n\nexperience of United Nations intervention strengthens our belief that now, more than ever, the world needs a strong, reformed United Nations."}
{"text": "As discussions on Security Council reform have reached a crucial stage, it is time for us to acknowledge that, in spite of its limitations, the United Nations \u2014 the forum of nations \u2014 has become the conscience of humanity."}
{"text": "Its present and future role can be addressed only when one reflects on recent changes in the world and on the Organization\u2019s capacity to adapt to the new challenges posed by development, the debt crisis, the specific needs of the least developed countries, terrorism and the issues of human rights, peace and collective security."}
{"text": "In that context, it is desirable for the United Nations to modify its structure in order to be better able to face new and old challenges and promote the values of our civilization, founded on the principles of freedom and democracy."}
{"text": "The desired enlargement of the Security Council, as envisaged, is now a requirement of the greatest democratic importance."}
{"text": "But while it is necessary, it is not in itself sufficient to ensure the harmonious and efficient functioning of the United Nations system."}
{"text": "We must go further, beyond mere expansion, to realize the ambitions that Member States have for the United Nations."}
{"text": "Security Council reform should not overshadow the need to review the other United Nations organs, in particular the Economic and Social Council, the Secretariat and the General Assembly, with a view to strengthening their mandates, and enabling the President of the General Assembly to play a primary role in seeking solutions to international problems."}
{"text": "Also in the context of reform, my country looks forward to the establishment of the new Peacebuilding Commission and to the creation of multi-year standing funds."}
{"text": "That would enable countries emerging from conflict to receive real, substantial contributions in support of rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts and would help those countries lay the foundations for sustainable development."}
{"text": "The international community has invested heavily in the work of rebuilding State structures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has provided significant support through the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)."}
{"text": "I convey the deep gratitude of the Congolese people."}
{"text": "In the context of the holding of transparent multiparty elections to put an end to the crisis of legitimacy and the endless loop of transitions, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is taking giant steps towards concluding the transition process."}
{"text": "I would like to assure the Assembly of the determination of the Government of National Unity to carry out the transition in accordance with the constitutional timetable."}
{"text": "The adoption by referendum of a draft constitution by the end of the year will make the process irreversible."}
{"text": "The elections must take place."}
{"text": "And it is certain that they will take place, because of the great determination of the Congolese people and the great commitment of the Government of National Unity."}
{"text": "The harmonious progress in the process, despite some logistic constraints related to the immense size of the national territory and the complexity of the voter registration process, leads us to predict with confidence that the various electoral deadlines will be met."}
{"text": "To date, nearly 12 million voters have been registered, bearing out the enthusiasm that has been in evidence since the start of the registration process."}
{"text": "It is now urgent to quickly stabilize the security situation, including, in particular, through the prompt resolution of the worrisome issue of the disarmament of foreign armed groups, which threaten to disturb, even compromise, the proper holding of elections."}
{"text": "It should be recalled that it is urgent to support the efforts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to put an end to the presence of armed groups in the eastern part of the national territory and ensure their repatriation, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States."}
{"text": "Adequate support for the training and equipping of our restructured and integrated armed forces, as well as the firm engagement of MONUC, will lead those groups to disarm."}
{"text": "However, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has never preferred the military option or ever felt that it was the only possible way to ensure the repatriation of the foreign armed elements that have proliferated in the North and South Kivus."}
{"text": "Therefore we have maintained contacts, through various intermediaries, with representatives of the Front d\u00e9mocratique pour la lib\u00e9ration du Rwanda, which has 32\n\nkept open the possibility of sustained voluntary disarmament followed by the voluntary repatriation of Rwandese armed elements."}
{"text": "Two sets of consultations were held \u2014 in March and in September 2005 \u2014 but so far they have not led to the hoped-for results."}
{"text": "If they fail, we will have to reconsider the option of forced disarmament, no matter what the cost for the Congolese armed forces, to whom it will fall to enforce it."}
{"text": "The Democratic Republic of the Congo is grateful to the Security Council for having authorized MONUC to take action under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, whose application has had real results in Ituri."}
{"text": "Recourse to Chapter VII in other areas, however, in particular in the North and South Kivus, has not yet had the full deterrent effect anticipated."}
{"text": "Therefore, is it not time to consider, as the Security Council has wished, what assistance to provide to the Forces arm\u00e9es de la R\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique du Congo to realize the forced disarmament of the militias?"}
{"text": "Naturally, the successful outcome of such an operation will also depend on the determination of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of MONUC, and, above all, on the sincere commitment of our neighbours."}
{"text": "The latter must refrain from any form of negative interference that would compromise efforts to neutralize the militias and other armed groups."}
{"text": "Beyond our security and strictly political concerns, we must also meet the legitimate needs of a population that for years has been deprived of its basic subsistence requirements."}
{"text": "The economic and social policy of the Transitional Government seeks, in the short term, to meet the requirements to combat poverty, as well as to restructure the legal and financial sectors and to help restart productive activities \u2014 areas where a certain degree of success has been achieved."}
{"text": "The State budget has increased substantially, the exchange rate has been stabilized, inflation is under control and, for the past three years, growth rates have ranged from 6 to 7 per cent."}
{"text": "Those favourable economic developments have enabled us to launch a number of recovery plans in the areas of basic infrastructure and education, as well as in the field of health, by combating major epidemics and pandemics."}
{"text": "But the pace of progress in the social sphere is slow: very slow, in view of the people\u2019s numerous expectations."}
{"text": "In order to consolidate the gains we have made, we will need to pick up the pace of our activities and rapidly institute social initiatives that will have a visible impact."}
{"text": "We therefore welcome the commitments made by our bilateral and multilateral partners to assist us in that direction."}
{"text": "The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is well aware of the importance of regional cooperation and of good-neighbourliness."}
{"text": "For that reason, we support the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative \u2014 in conjunction with the Group of Friends of the Great Lakes Region \u2014 to organize in Nairobi an International Conference on Peace, Security, Democracy and Development in the region."}
{"text": "My country has been the main battleground of an armed conflict, with a toll of over 3 million dead, massive infringements of human rights and of international humanitarian law, the destruction of hospitals, schools, roads and bridges and the looting of natural resources and other forms of wealth."}
{"text": "For that reason, my country hopes to be one of the main beneficiaries of the special reconstruction fund that has been set up within the framework of the International Conference on the Great Lakes region, and a priority zone in the subregion for rehabilitation and development."}
{"text": "The trials experienced by the Congolese people, and by all the peoples of the Great Lakes region, enable us to understand the aspirations for peace voiced by other peoples."}
{"text": "We therefore support the peace process in the Middle East."}
{"text": "The Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip."}
{"text": "We believe that that initiative is an important step forward, one that should be consolidated in order to ensure peace and to put an end to the cycle of violence in that region."}
{"text": "The sensitivity and the complexity of that situation further emphasize the commitment made by the State of Israel and by the Palestinian Authority to reach a negotiated solution to the crisis in the Middle East."}
{"text": "I also wish to commend the United Nations and the African Union for their efforts to bring the elections in Burundi and the Central African Republic to a successful conclusion."}
{"text": "The positive outcome of the reconciliation processes in those two countries, as well as the prospects for positive developments in the situation in the Congo, bode well for the emergence of a new period of stability, democracy and prosperity for Central Africa."}
{"text": "33\n\n"}
{"text": "In view of new threats, I wish to reaffirm the commitment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the principles upon which our collective security is based."}
{"text": "The coming years will be a time of increased competition among nations in the areas of trade, financial markets and research, including nuclear research; rapid globalization, made possible through information and communication technologies, has given rise at times to sometimes uncontrolled liberalization and bitter competition."}
{"text": "It is thus our historic responsibility to equip the United Nations with the resources and structures not only to keep the peace wherever necessary and to guarantee our collective security wherever it is threatened, but also to better address issues of economic and social development, to establish more equitable rules of the game for international trade, to fight collectively and effectively against illiteracy, ignorance, intolerance, epidemics, disease and natural disasters, and, naturally, against terrorism, violence and injustice in all their forms so that we can build a more brotherly, peaceful, humane and just world."}
{"text": " 109.\t "}
{"text": "I should like to extend to Mr. Gaston Thorn our warmest congratulations on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly."}
{"text": "These congratulations are an expression of our appreciation of his outstanding personality, which enjoys our complete respect, and which will undoubtedly ensure the success of this session, owing to his wisdom and guidance."}
{"text": "Our appreciation also goes to his country, which has a special standing in Europe."}
{"text": "I need not remind the Assembly of my country's desire to consolidate and strengthen its relations with all the friendly countries of Europe, which we consider to be the source of modern civilization and technology from which the entire world has benefited."}
{"text": "I need hardly say that the Yemen Arab Republic is desirous of developing friendly relations with all the countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect and equality, in an attempt to establish positive and fruitful cooperation that will lay the foundations for world peace and co-operation."}
{"text": "110.\tI should like also to express our appreciation of the valuable efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in carrying out his major tasks with such great sincerity, for which we thank him."}
{"text": "111.\tMy country would also like to extend a welcome to the three new States Members of our international Organization; their entry renders it more important and is one more step towards universality."}
{"text": "On behalf of Yemen, I should like to congratulate the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and extend to them our sincerest wishes for a positive contribution to the work of the United Nations."}
{"text": "112.\tThe twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly marked a tangible turning point in international relations."}
{"text": "The Palestinian people have regained some of their usurped rights."}
{"text": "On the level of economic and constructive co-operation the special session achieved many of its objectives."}
{"text": "That special session was convened on the initiative of the President of Algeria, Mr. Houari Boumediene, while the success of the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session was undoubtedly due to the efforts of his brilliant Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika who presided over the two sessions and won the appreciation and admiration of us all."}
{"text": "113.\t"}
{"text": "The present session is, like all sessions, dealing with many important topics."}
{"text": "However, the Palestine cause is the focus of the attention of the Member States and of world public opinion as a whole because of the dangers inherent in that cause which threaten the Middle East and the entire world with a new explosion whose dimensions and effects it would be difficult to assess."}
{"text": "It is well known that the land of the Palestinian people, who number nearly 4 million, is still usurped and that their legitimate rights are still trampled under foot."}
{"text": "The majority of these people are suffering horrible repression under Israeli occupation, while others lead a life of misery in their own lands and in refugee camps scattered in neighboring countries."}
{"text": "Still another segment of the Palestinian population remains dispersed inside and outside the area."}
{"text": "114.\tIsrael, which has dispersed and removed the indigenous people by force from their land and which has usurped their property, continues to deny their rights, to prevent them from returning to their homes, trades and farms, to ignore their legitimate and recognized rights and to defy the relevant resolutions of the United Nations."}
{"text": "You will recall that as a result of that defiance the Assembly, in resolution 3236 (XXIX), expressed particular awareness thereof, when it reaffirmed almost unanimously \"the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in Palestine\", including its right \"to national independence and sovereignty\"."}
{"text": "The General Assembly also reaffirmed \"the inalienable right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which they have been displaced and uprooted\"."}
{"text": "115.\tWe should also like to remind the Assembly that the relevant resolutions of the United Nations last year and in previous years recognized that the Palestinian people is a principal party to the search for a durable and just peace in the Middle East."}
{"text": "In order to find such a durable and just settlement of the Middle East question we must give the Palestinian people its full national rights, because in addition to complete withdrawal from occupied Arab territories, this is the core of the problem."}
{"text": "116.\tWe also note that the aforementioned resolution requested the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its thirtieth session on the implementation of this historic decision."}
{"text": "My delegation will study this report and express its opinion as to the steps it is necessary to take in order to restore the rights of and redress injustice to a people for whose unhappy fate the entire world is responsible, because its present situation contradicts the elementary rules of justice as well as the mores and principles of the United Nations."}
{"text": "117.\tWhat is applicable to the usurped rights of the Palestinian people is also applicable to the usurped lands of three States Members of the United Nations which since 1967 have been under military occupation."}
{"text": "Israel continues to ignore and defy all the international resolutions requesting it to withdraw from the territories which it has usurped by force of arms."}
{"text": "118.\tIt would be fitting for the international community to consider taking the deterrent measures provided for in United Nations documents in order finally to put an end to Israel's intransigence and defiance of United Nations resolutions."}
{"text": "119.\tCan the Christian and Moslem worlds forget that the sacred city of Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories\u2014Jerusalem with all its sacred buildings, its history, the position it holds and the spiritual meaning it has in the hearts of millions of Christians and Moslems?"}
{"text": "Is it possible that Jerusalem should remain occupied or that the occupation of the indivisible parts of the territories of three sovereign States should persist, and that the rights of the Palestinian people, which have been recognized by the entire world, should continue to be ignored without such a position leading to an explosion that would impede any effort aimed at establishing a durable and just peace, thus threatening the whole region and the entire world with grave dangers?"}
{"text": "120.\tWe must refer on this occasion to the new, advanced, additional weapons which Israel is to receive and with which it will threaten the entire area, weapons capable of carrying nuclear warheads, weapons of mass destruction."}
{"text": "I should like to point out that the provision of such weapons, the cost of which runs into thousands of millions of dollars, would encourage Israel to continue its occupation of Arab lands and to ignore inalienable and legitimate rights."}
{"text": "121.\tI should like to repeat once more what has been said from this very rostrum by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait."}
{"text": "He said that \"The totality of American commitments to Israel constitutes an ominous precedent; it strengthens Israel's determination to resist withdrawal from the other occupied Arab territories ...\""}
{"text": "[2368th meeting, para. 141]."}
{"text": "This topic is one of great concern to the Yemen Arab Republic because it impedes the efforts that are needed to find a just solution, encourages the aggressor to cling to the fruits of his aggression and may further encourage Israel to continue the pastime of political blackmail it has specialized in, finding in the Zionist circles that support it a means of acquiring all it asks for, freely, unconditionally and without making any concessions."}
{"text": "122.\t"}
{"text": "This continued response to the Israeli policy of political blackmail at the expense of the national interests of others will deepen doubts and lead to great disappointments, The world, since the beginning of this year, has witnessed many conferences and meetings at various levels, and the policy of detente has made great strides forward thanks to the Helsinki agreement."}
{"text": "My country, which believes in the benefits of international co-operation, has welcomed and contributed to many of these regional and international conferences such as the conferences of non-aligned countries."}
{"text": "My country has also given particular attention to the noble and human task carried out by the Islamic Conference and we hope that that body will be able to participate in the activities of the United Nations as an observer. 123.\t"}
{"text": "I am happy to state that my Government attaches particular importance to the agenda item concerning the strengthening of respect for the rules of international law in relations between States and the consolidation of the role of the United Nations in this respect because we uphold the principles of international peace and security, which should be respected to enable the entire world to enjoy stability and permit the developing nations to undertake the projects that are vital to ensure their rebirth and development."}
{"text": "This development, which the Yemen Arab Republic is exerting every effort to carry out with the necessary speed and sincerity, is the target that our President, Ibrahim Al-Hamdi, has placed at the head of the list of national aspirations he is trying to fulfill."}
{"text": "We also hope that the international community will be able to find ways and means to strengthen the role of the United Nations so that it may carry out its task of safeguarding and consolidating peace by obliging those who rebel against and defy its decisions to respect the rules and obligations of the United Nations and of international law."}
{"text": "124.\tYemen joined the other countries of the third world at the Lima Conference."}
{"text": "It also participated with great care and attention in the seventh special session of the Assembly, devoted to the search for a new world economic order built on justice and positivity."}
{"text": "We welcome resolution 3362 (S-VII) adopted by the General Assembly at the end of the session, as well as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which, if respected by the developed and rich countries, will bridge the gap that currently divides them from the developing States."}
{"text": "125.\tI turn now to the subject of the law of the sea."}
{"text": "When the General Assembly adopted its historic decision which, by its letter and spirit, declared that the sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction were the common heritage of mankind [resolution 2749 (XXV)], the international community took a courageous step forward."}
{"text": "It was one of the most just and equitable decisions taken by the United Nations, in our view, because that was the first time since the inception of the Organization that a decision had been taken whereby 70 per cent of the earth would be subject to new and just concepts of equality for all with respect to rights and equitable distribution of resources."}
{"text": "126.\t"}
{"text": "The Yemen Arab Republic has shown great interest in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurdisdiction, as well as in the first, second and third sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea."}
{"text": "Yemen adheres to the principle of the exercise of sovereignty over territorial waters on the basis of the just resolutions adopted by the African States and the non-aligned countries, all of which affirmed that principle to which we all adhere."}
{"text": "127.\t"}
{"text": "Our adherence to the principle of innocent passage basically arises out of our recognition of the right of coastal States to exercise sovereignty over their under-water land, irrespective of whether there is an international waterway through their territorial waters."}
{"text": "It is, of course, obvious that our acceptance of this concept does not mean that the coastal States have the right to impede the freedom of trade or other navigation on the contrary."}
{"text": "However, military passage through territorial waters must be subject to conditions, some of which are nominal only, that give the coastal State the right to exercise its national sovereignty and the sense that it is doing so."}
{"text": "Those conditions will, when necessary, enable it to ensure its peace and security."}
{"text": "128.\tWe also consider that total ownership by the coastal States of mineral, fish and other resources of the economic zone, whether in the sea-bed, the ocean floor or the subsoil thereof, should be very clearly specified in the provisions of the law of the sea which is currently being elaborated."}
{"text": "We are looking forward with great optimism and open-mindedness to the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to be held next spring."}
{"text": "We shall welcome all opinions provided they do not deprive us of our right to exercise sovereignty over our territorial waters, wherever those coastal waters may be, and do not hinder our freedom of exploitation in waters of our economic zone."}
{"text": "129.\t"}
{"text": "The Yemen Arab Republic was one of the countries which participated with great interest in the first, second and third sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]."}
{"text": "It continues to devote particular attention to that organization, because Yemen has felt optimistic over the future of UNCTAD ever since its establishment in 1964."}
{"text": "Indeed, we consider it an excellent forum in which to draw up practical measures that may eventually narrow the gulf separating the rich, developed countries from the deprived, developing countries."}
{"text": "In fact, UNCTAD has, during its three sessions, adopted positive and practical resolutions and, although its decisions have been implemented only partially to date, we feel that the advanced, rich countries will implement the resolutions already adopted and any subsequent ones, because a just distribution of wealth is in the common interests of all mankind; the rich cannot continue to exploit others ad infinitum."}
{"text": "130.\tAmong the causes occupying the full attention of Yemen, its Government and people are the struggles for freedom and national independence, for the elimination of racial discrimination and for a decrease of spheres of influence."}
{"text": "It is therefore my responsibility and duty to deal with the following issues."}
{"text": "My Government wishes to express great satisfaction over the end of the cruel and bitter war that afflicted three Asian States, namely the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, the Republic of Viet Nam and Cambodia."}
{"text": "We hope those three countries will be successful in rebuilding what has been destroyed by the war and healing its wounds."}
{"text": "At the same time, we consider it necessary for the world as a whole to contribute to that noble human task."}
{"text": "131.\tWe also firmly support the legitimate applications of the two Viet Nam for membership in the United Nations."}
{"text": "132.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic has taken particular care to exercise its right to membership in the/Id Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean."}
{"text": "We did so in the interest of excluding great-Power military rivalry from that critically important part of the world, which has become a natural passageway for the super-tankers that carry a vital source of energy, whose importance is clear to all whether in peace, in disturbances or in war."}

{"text": "These countries, which are trying to develop despite their unfavourable situation, stubbornly continue to work hard to adjust their economies."}
{"text": "However, in current conditions, which are so adverse, and in the  absence of simultaneous adjustment by developed countries, such efforts increasingly raise the social and political price.\n\n"}
{"text": "The international political panorama facing the developing countries is sensitive and unfavourable; the prices of commodities decline constantly and systematically; the terns of trade deteriorate daily; all kinds of protectionism are becoming more acute; the flew of capital investment is declining, and interest rates are still high in real terms; monetary and financial instability and inequality in the terms of trade persist, and it remains impossible to achieve the desired goals; external debt has become an irreversible burden that gets less bearable daily, and a problem the developing countries find increasingly difficult to solve."}
{"text": "None the less, we highly appreciate and praise the position taken by some developed countries in totally or partially forgiving the external debt contracted by developing countries."}
{"text": "That helps developing countries carry out more appropriate and reasonable structural adjustments and improve their economic and social situation."}
{"text": "The Government, the Democratic Party and the people of Equatorial Guinea consider that current economic trends and the grave economic situation of developing countries require the urgent adoption of measures and action to foster substantive structural reforms in the context of international economic relations with a view to establishing a system that will contribute to constant equitable growth in the world economy."}

{"text": "External debt is the greatest handicap to the economic and social development of developing countries."}
{"text": "High real interest rates currently consume a disproportionate part of the export income, the gross domestic product and the savings of underdeveloped countries."}
{"text": "The sacrifices made by the peoples of those countries have caused serious social disruption, threatening their economic and social stability."}
{"text": "It is difficult for those countries to pay their external debt in view of the current economic situation.\n\n"}
{"text": "We believe that solving the problem of external debt depends principally on the creation of conditions more favourable to more rapid economic development in debtor countries, on the basis of joint responsibility, through co-operation between all the parties concerned, including the Governments of debtor countries, the Governments of creditor countries and the World Bank and other international financial institutions."}
{"text": "Like so many other peoples, the people of Equatorial Guinea is deeply concerned about the drug trafficking and illegal drug use which in recent years have reached alarming proportions in many countries."}
{"text": "The growing magnitude of this problem amounts to a social calamity for mankind and must be fought courageously and decisively on all fronts and with all available national and international weapons."}
{"text": "drug trafficking destabilizes the very structure of States, using corruption and the most varied criminal resources in an intricate network of operations, conspiracies and schemes involving ail social strata and the most powerful economic sectors, including the fundamental structures of public power."}
{"text": "In some States, this poses a threat to national security and sovereignty."}
{"text": "It is time, therefore, to view this as a universal problem, because of the social, economic and political factors at stake."}
{"text": "I wish also to address the role of the international community in the world of science and technology."}
{"text": "Today more than ever before it is necessary to support the creation in third-world countries of a network of world-scope institutions and research centres devoted to implementing, developing and promoting the most advanced technology."}
{"text": "It is necessary to encourage and organize broader and more coherent international co-operation in that sphere."}
{"text": "To achieve this, we must adopt without delay an international code of conduct on the genuine transfer and exchange of technology."}
{"text": "In the context of those convictions and criteria, we in Equatorial Guinea have established a council for scientific research, which has already taken the first steps in its research."}
{"text": "From this rostrum we appeal to the international community to work together to accelerate and support efforts in that sector."}
{"text": "I cannot conclude without saying that Equatorial Guinea appreciates and values the efforts made since 1982, the year of the first donors' conference for the economic revitalization of our country, held in Geneva under United Nations auspices."}
{"text": "Those efforts have made possible a new plan of structural adjustment and tangible economic improvements in our society, in keeping with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank."}
{"text": "We are certain that the programme for sectoral meetings adopted during the most recent follow-up round-table of the donors' conference, held in November 1988 in Geneva, will be effectively and punctually implemented with a view to achieving its aims, thanks to the ongoing support of the United Nations Development programme and the three major donors: the World Bank, Spain and France."}
{"text": "I wish in conclusion to reaffirm my conviction that, under the excellent guidance of Major-General Garba, the Assembly will achieve the desired success."}
{"text": "Mr. President, it was a source of great pleasure for me to see you elected to preside over the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly at a time when our Organization has recorded in the pages of history the twenty-fifth anniversary of its founding in San Francisco when it was set up to guide the destiny of the peoples Members of the Organization and serve as a repository for the principles for the maintenance and preservation of the peace and progress that our civilization demands."}
{"text": "44.\tThe election which has led to your being chosen to preside over this Assembly a very wise choice indeed is a tribute to your great country, which has contributed to the development of the history of free nations a tradition of peace that serves as an example for the legal community that we constitute a country which has always commanded respect and admiration from all corners of the earth."}
{"text": "Your election is also a tribute of recognition and respect rendered to your wisdom, your qualities as a statesman and your devotion to the cause defended by the nations assembled in this world Organization."}
{"text": "Under your enlightened and experienced guidance we are sure that the Assembly will embark upon a session which in and of itself is of great importance because of the tremendous tasks confronting all delegations, the significance of the anniversary that is coming up shortly and because here, as never before, a spirit of understanding and coexistence should prevail above all momentary considerations so that we may inaugurate a new phase in international law under the most auspicious circumstances."}
{"text": "We are duty bound to display this spirit because of the wisdom, the experience and the maturity which we have gained during twenty-four regular sessions of the General Assembly, sessions which have led us to the point where we will be commemorating this exceptional event very shortly in solemn ceremony and celebration."}
{"text": "45.\tIt is, therefore, an honor for my delegation to convey to you our good wishes on your election and we are sure that your wisdom will enlighten and guide our thinking and our decisions during the discharge of the mandate that we have received from our respective Governments."}
{"text": "46.\tDuring the holding of the twenty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly the Dominican Republic, in a desire to contribute in some way to the historic importance of the session upon which we are just embarking, conveyed to the SecretaryGeneral an expression of our desire that as part of the methodology of the specific question of a new reform of the United Nations Charter we should include consideration of the right of veto in the Security Council and the Powers enjoying that right, the apolitical status of outer space and the right of new small States to be admitted to the world Organization."}
{"text": "47.\ttwenty-five years after the founding of the United Nations we cannot fail to recognize the changes that have occurred in the world of today in all essential aspects and, most particularly, with respect to international life upon the emergence of new States, all of which makes it incumbent upon us to find new formulae to bring the constituent principles of the Organization up to date taking into account the experience gained over a quarter of a century and the ideals that justify its existence."}
{"text": "48.\tWe all recall very clearly the debates that developed in connexion with Article 27 of the Charter of the United Nations."}
{"text": "I refer to the right of veto which was accepted finally in the form in which it now appears in the Charter."}
{"text": "49.\tWe must recognize the fact that after the last World War and mankind is still suffering its residual effects statesmen wanted to lay unshakable foundations for the maintenance and preservation of peace in the world but none the less, the spirit of war had an impact on the solutions involving the interests of the victorious States."}
{"text": "That situation was most typical among the great Powers."}
{"text": "I venture to believe that that cause and no other, taken together with a need to find a substitute for the classical system of alliances to maintain international equilibrium, predominated in the deliberations that finally led to the provision of the veto in the Security Council."}
{"text": "50.\tThere seems no doubt that to a considerable degree the veto has fulfilled the objective for which it was created, despite the frequent exercise of this right by the States that possess the veto."}
{"text": "But the facts tend to show that if on some occasions this tool has proved useful to avoid greater evils, it is equally certain that in other instances the frequency with which this exceptional right has been exercised, a right which is discriminatory in the light of the principles of democracy, has come to constitute an obstacle to the progress that the United Nations should have attained in achieving the purposes for which it was set up."}
{"text": "51.\tThis modem age, with the present stage of development of space science and the achievements of man through his journeys to the moon, has created a new individual and collective mentality, and we should admit this now."}
{"text": "The States that make up our Organization are not immune to the impact of this new mentality."}
{"text": "52.\tHowever, we cannot deny that man is just as imperfect as he was on the first day of his creation, but it is obvious that, like civilizations, generations move and are transformed in accordance with the immutable laws of human progress."}
{"text": "53.\tFor this reason the fundamental instrument which governs us cannot have failed to feel the impact of these uncontrollable pressures."}
{"text": "Hence we find the reason justifying the need for reforms of the principles which, until the past decade, and particularly if we look back twenty-five years, were appropriate to mitigate the imperfections of international life and the conflicts that it has been possible to confine to certain areas of the world without allowing these conflicts to involve the Members of the Organization in a new total warlike adventure where the last word would be had by those who had predominance in nuclear weapons that are capable of wiping out every vestige of human life and civilization from the face of the earth."}
{"text": "54.\tAccordingly, on the occasion of this important Assembly, concern about the veto has cropped up once again."}
{"text": "It might be said that recently an awareness of the veto has been developed that has come to be expressed by certain radical manifestations, as in 'he."}
{"text": "case of Brazil which has set forth the criterion that the veto should be prohibited if we wish to preserve the United Nations from the decadence likely to lead to its final dissolution."}
{"text": "55.\tOur country's initiative would constitute a step forward in this direction."}
{"text": "It pays tribute to the law of nature that does not proceed by leaps and bounds, and at the same time it is in accordance with the proven experience that the life of nations and of men develops in accordance with a process of evolution that cannot nor should not be violated, subject to the penalty of retreating in a move backward to previous positions or a position marking a step even further back."}
{"text": "56.\tFor that reason we are advocating a solution which moves between the enshrinement of the division of the veto with the feature of one veto for two votes or for the adoption of a quota of vetoes."}
{"text": "If circumstances would permit, this would be the position we would take if we agreed to revise the Charter."}
{"text": "57.\tThe legal rules that constitute the body of law governing outer space would be incomplete if they did not rest upon a fundamental rule drawn from the notion of the apolitical status of space, the area in which those rules should be applied and respected."}
{"text": "We are dealing here with such a new and sensitive international contribution as the idea of jurisprudence to apply to outer space."}
{"text": "In this exceedingly new field we shall certainly have to grapple with great difficulties, periods of stagnation and experiences, and we will have to exercise the utmost wisdom in coping with this task."}
{"text": "In the light of the strictest provisions of the Charter it will also be essential to think above all of the survival of the human race in the face of the dangers inherent in the conquest of the vast reaches of the stars."}
{"text": "58.\tWith these concerns in mind, and convinced as we are that the progress of technology in respect of the conquest of outer space is proceeding at a dizzy pace, we have sketched out our concern which might seem a bit sudden if it were not for the fact that we are already confronted with inescapable facts and realities in referring as we have to the fact that outer space should be considered as apolitical in this twenty- fifth session of the General Assembly."}
{"text": "We have made these comments because we are desirous of contributing by this expression of our goodwill to the celebration of a quarter of a century of the United Nations."}
{"text": "59.\tThe advent of new, smaller States to independent international life has been the subject of speculation and informal public statements which may perhaps have created a degree of confusion in certain international quarters, and even prejudices that can mislead the public conscience."}
{"text": "The reaction that has been produced, as was logical to assume, has sometimes led to the possibility of people thinking somewhat lightly of how far we can go in weakening the legal equality of States by a system of restrictions."}
{"text": "60.\tIf this idea were to gain a little more currency, it would foster various prejudices harmful to our Organization and could eventually perhaps in some way undermine people's confidence in the raison d'etre of this Organization, an organization that we should defend firmly against all obstacles that may to a greater or lesser degree affect its necessary development in the interest of maintaining the legal order free from discrimination of any kind."}
{"text": "61.\tObviously, we should foresee events and prevent the abnormalities that may affect our Organization."}
{"text": "In that manner we will preserve the legacy of experience that we, the peoples that make up this Organization, have garnered here after two and a half decades of what has often been stormy activity which an organization which has met the tests to which it has been subjected up until this great moment in history."}
{"text": "62.\tAccordingly, it would be appropriate for us to look forward to the situation that may arise in connexion with the admission of new smaller States."}

{"text": "63.\tMy delegation has always supported the principles of political decolonization and the right to self determination of peoples, which have been given concrete expression under the aegis of the United Nations."}
{"text": "We have kept this position and we shall continue to do so, convinced as we are that this provision contained in the constitution of this Organization is in accordance with the most appropriate procedure for forming the national conscience of the people so favored, and to ensure that the transitional period towards the highest degree of self-government can achieve at least a minimum level of efficiency, in order that it may enjoy lasting status within the international legal community."}
{"text": "64.\tBut, together with political decolonization, we would also like to see, concomitantly, the idea of economic decolonization, which is possible only if the States Members of our Organization share the idea of economic interdependence, which is becoming more and more pressing for the same reasons for which we pay homage in this world of today to the principle of the interdependence of States."}
{"text": "We should strengthen this edifice without it being necessary to distinguish between dissimilarities of population, territory, or social, economic, cultural or political development, which reflect the characteristic features and peculiarities of these States, and we should increasingly make progress in this idea of international economic interdependence."}
{"text": "65.\tWe have maintained this line of approach and we will continue to maintain it in the Economic and Social Council and in all the subsidiary bodies which are entrusted with the heavy responsibility of fostering the progress of peoples through modern methods."}
{"text": "Many barriers of prejudices and archaic conventional attitudes will still have to be overthrown."}
{"text": "In this task which confronts the States Members of the Organization, the Dominican Republic has steadily opted in favor of the adoption of new formula and rules which can lead us to solutions that will eradicate the pressures and international tensions that allow us no respite."}
{"text": "66.\tIn recent years the Dominican Republic has advocated a formula to put an end to the conflict in the Middle East in accordance with methods for the solution of situations of this kind."}
{"text": "We are concerned about the state of stagnation in which this effort for peace has been bogged down; yet the effectiveness of this effort is the responsibility not only of all free peoples of the world but also of the Organization itself."}

{"text": "The renewal of the mandate entrusted by the SecretaryGeneral to his Special Representative, Ambassador Jarring, has not only helped to reaffirm our faith in the instruments available to us to restore peace where it has been breached, but it has also served to lessen considerable international tensions considerably and it has strengthened the hope that, finally, it will be possible to come to terms acceptable to the parties involved."}

{"text": "We are proud of being a founding Member of this community of nations, which is the greatest that has ever existed since the origin of mankind."}
{"text": "71.\tWe must feel gratified when we see that the United States of America has been withdrawing sizable contingents of troops from the center of military operations in that area and that the central Government has shown that it will continue to withdraw these troops in accordance with the statements made by President Nixon."}
{"text": "It is highly significant that this fact should have occurred precisely when we were entering upon the twenty-fifth regular session of the General Assembly of the world Organization, with new prospects opening up for the future of the States Members of this Organization."}

{"text": "In all sincerity I believe that this is perhaps the most important item for those of us who are participating in this General Assembly, and we would hope that the Assembly will emerge from this session fortified with all its constructive potential."}
{"text": "This would serve as a kind of lever of Archimedes, which is the will of all peoples on this commemorative anniversary to mark the dawn of a new era in the world in which good understanding will prevail designed to achieve the goal we have set ourselves in the face of the dilemma with which the unbridled arms race confronts us a race into which we have been impelled by lack of confidence and by our blind attitude towards the danger that hangs over us."}
{"text": "74.\tIn behalf of the Government I represent, may I be permitted to pay a tribute of gratitude for this important development which has allayed the unrest and tensions to which we have been subjected for so many years?"}
{"text": "75.\tWe should also take into account the efforts made to come to an agreement on a treaty to prohibit the emplacement of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed, the ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof, which in truth would constitute an effective step towards the conclusion of the treaty on general and complete disarmament which is so anxiously awaited."}
{"text": "76.\t"}
{"text": "In addition, for the same reasons, we would praise the action that has been undertaken to halt the development of chemical and bacteriological means of warfare and also arduous efforts under way to ensure that such weapons are prohibited from the arsenals of nations."}
{"text": "77.\tIt is disturbing to note that the production of such means of destruction should have marked a considerable step backwards in international thinking on war despite the Geneva Protocol of 1925 which prohibits the use of this type of weapon."}
{"text": "And that reversion to a position we had left behind long age under the influence of the lofty principles of humanity and should have created a situation in which the General Assembly finds it necessary to call upon States to fulfil the principles of that important Protocol."}
{"text": "78.\tAccordingly, it would be well for us to come to an agreement which not only guarantees observance of the prohibition in Platonic terms but also provides for the verification of compliance with this Protocol."}
{"text": "Without the latter measure, which has already received the support of some Members of the Organization, we shall not be able to achieve chemical and bacteriological disarmament and thus safeguard mankind from weapons that are as inhuman as nuclear weapons themselves."}
{"text": "79.\t"}
{"text": "Every effort that is made to arrive at reasonable disarmament and to avoid the overflow of these vast arsenals, which are a source of concern to us, will command the vigorous support of the Dominican Republic."}
{"text": "We therefore viewed certain relaxations of tension which have been brought about in Geneva in the field of disarmament as a promising omen that will increase the confidence of peace-loving peoples."}
{"text": "80.\tSince the United Nations has been able to survive all the tests to which it has been subjected so far, this argument alone would suffice to justify the efforts we should exert to ensure that it continues to achieve the objectives for which it was created, at a decisive moment when the scourge of war had imperiled all of modern civilization."}
{"text": "81.\tTrue, there has been much criticism of the United Nations."}
{"text": "We must confess that much of this criticism is justified, but we cannot deny that most of it is exaggerated or not really justified if we examine the criticism objectively."}
{"text": "82.\tNo matter how strict we may be, we cannot deny its positive achievements which have proved to be milestones in history."}

{"text": "However that may be, under the sheltering umbrella of the principles of the Charter we have been able to demonstrate how useful dialog is at the high level of this Organization."}

{"text": "84.\tIt is understandable that despite the complexities of international life some would like to see the United Nations take more dynamic action, and more willingness to comply with its resolutions."}
{"text": "I venture to surmise that this is due largely to the sensibilities involved and the magnitude of the interests often in conflict."}
{"text": "But that does not mean that we should not foster the idea of a fresh endeavor and for this it will probably be necessary to bring the Charter up to date so that it will reflect the changes that have occurred and will continue to occur in our time."}
{"text": "85.\tWhile it is obvious that the principles of the United Nations are influential even as they are now structured, we would hope that its legal and moral authority will be exercised with greater efficiency when they have been revised and have had time to acquire their full strength and vigor."}
{"text": "86.\tI should now like to make a comment concerning the record of the tremendous accomplishments of the United Nations during the years of its existence and say that my delegation would venture to suggest that if the Organization has not been very effective, as its critics allege, that is in large measure the fault of ourselves, the Member States, because in fact we have not given the Organization all the support and effective collaboration needed to uphold those principles and resolutions which have not been applied or have been applied imperfectly or very tardily."}

{"text": "10.\tFinally I should like to heartily congratulate the people of Saint Lucia, whose country has just been admitted as the one hundred and fifty-second Member of the United Nations, thus occupying its rightful place in the family of nations."}
{"text": "11.\tSince the last session of our Assembly, several events have taken place in various parts of the world."}
{"text": "Some of them have fortunately created conditions conducive to the consolidation of detente and international co-operation, while others, on the contrary, are extremely disquieting, not only for the reasons I have just mentioned, but also to peace and security in the world."}
{"text": "12.\tFor all the non-aligned countries, which make up two thirds of this Assembly, as for the entire international community, the most significant event of 1979 was indisputably the sixth Conference of non-aligned countries, which was recently held in Havana, the magnificent capital of the Republic of Cuba."}
{"text": "That Conference was a great victory, not only for the Government and the welcoming and hospitable people of Cuba, who so carefully and impeccably prepared it, but also for all peoples who cherish peace, independence and justice in the world."}
{"text": "At the same time it was a crushing defeat for imperialism and the reactionary forces which expended immense effort to sap the unity of the non- aligned movement in order to wreck it."}
{"text": "To judge by the result of the Sixth Conference, on which we do not wish to linger, it is absolutely impossible to doubt the effectiveness of the movement and its staunch resolve to assume its responsibilities in the conduct of international relations."}
{"text": "13.\tAs a fully-fledged member of that community 9f non-aligned countries, the Lao People's Democratic Republic heartily welcomes the success of the Sixth Conference and intends to play its full part within that movement, as we do in other international bodies, so as to make an active contribution to the common struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, apartheid and racism, and for peace, national independence, detente and the development of international co-operation."}
{"text": "14.\tOther events have contributed to the strengthening of international peace and security, and these are the resounding victories achieved by the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America in their heroic struggle against the anti-democratic and anti-national regimes which are the instruments of imperialism and international reactionaries."}
{"text": "15.\tHowever encouraging that situation may be, we must never lower our guard."}
{"text": "On the contrary, we must persevere and step up our struggle, because experience as proved that the more the imperialists and international reactionaries suffer defeats, the more cruel and perfidious they become, both in their policies and their actions."}
{"text": "16.\t"}
{"text": "We warmly welcome, first, the brilliant victory achieved by the people of fraternal Kampuchea, which finally, on 7 January 1979, overthrew the barbarous, genocidal and repressive regime of its tyrants."}
{"text": "On this subject we should recall that, after having finally vanquished the United States imperialists and their Lon Nol henchmen, on 17 April 1975 the heroic people of Kampuchea, instead of being able to enjoy their hard- won peace and independence, because of the treachery of the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique and who obey only the reactionaries of Peking [Beijing], met with a most tragic fate."}
{"text": "Indeed, practising an abject policy of genocide, the Pol Pot regime massacred more than 3 million Kampucheans and transformed Kampuchea into a vast unspeakable \"neo-Nazi slaughter-house\"."}
{"text": "17.\tFuthermore, in addition to the ghastly crimes they perpetrated against their own people the bloody regime of Pol Pot, on the one hand, created a permanent situation of tension in the border regions between Kampuchea and my country and, on the other hand, entered into conflict with Viet Nam, beginning with murderous border incidents which became an open war against Viet Nam and which ended in the resounding victory of Viet Nam over the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary forces."}
{"text": "That victory prompted the spontaneous uprising of the Kampuchean people which resulted, on7"}
{"text": "January 1979, in the overthrow of the regime of the tyrants and the establishment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea."}
{"text": "18.\t"}
{"text": "Thus, the Kampuchean people, under the guidance of the People's Revolutionary Council and the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea, became the true master of its country and its destiny."}
{"text": "Independence, sovereignty and freedom are once more firmly in the hands of the people of Kampuchea, who are practising a foreign policy of peace, independence, friendship and non-alignment, thus consolidating peace and stability in Indo-China, South-East Asia and throughout the world."}
{"text": "Thus, the present situation in Kampuchea is irreversible."}
{"text": "19.\tIt is a regrettable fact, however, that, after that great victory, the international reactionaries, in collusion with the imperialists, have persisted in trying to resuscitate the genocidal regime of Pol Pot which has been consigned to the past, by helping it still to claim a seat within our Organization."}
{"text": "These actions constitute a cynical interference in the internal affairs of the Kampuchean people."}
{"text": "20.\tAs far as we are concerned, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, in accordance with its position which has been repeatedly voiced, recognizes the People's Republic of Kampuchea as an independent and sovereign State which cannot and should never be subjected to threat or aggression by anyone."}
{"text": "The People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea, which is the sole legitimate and authentic representative of the Kampuchean people, must take possession of its seat in the United Nations and in all other international bodies."}
{"text": "No question relating to Kampuchea can be resolved without the participation of the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea."}
{"text": "21.\tTo respect the memory of the 3 million innocent Kampucheans who were massacred and to render justice to the further 4 million who survived and who have suffered so much at the hands of a genocidal regime unprecedented in the history of humanity, we request the expulsion from the United Nations of the representative of the murderous gang which in fact controls not one inch of the territory of the country and which no longer represents anyone, so that the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea may take its rightful seat."}
{"text": "22.\tThe Lao people salute the victory of the Iranian people, who overthrew and abolished a feudal, bloody, absolutist regime, thus becoming the true master of their country."}
{"text": "23.\tWe hail the brilliant victory of the people of Nicaragua, wrested by force of arms from the Fascist Somoza dictatorship."}
{"text": "That victory will give great momentum to the struggle of peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean against imperialism and in order to consolidate their national independence."}
{"text": "24.\tIn the Middle East, the situation continues to be explosive."}
{"text": "The Palestinian Arab people have suffered and continue to suffer from the exploitation and aggression of the Israeli Zionists and of the imperialists."}
{"text": "The quest for peace through the Camp David agreements and the so-called Egypt-Israel peace treaty16 only make the problem more serious and serve imperialism's designs for domination in the Middle East."}
{"text": "Those agreements are not in the interests of the Palestinian Arab people, nor in the interests of the other Arab peoples, nor indeed those of the Egyptian people themselves."}
{"text": "25.\tA lasting and equitable settlement of the problem must involve the total withdrawal of the Israeli forces of \"Treaty of Peace between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the State of Israel, signed at Washington on 26 March 1979."}

{"text": "31.\tIn the African continent, colonialism, racism and apartheid, which are already too anachronistic for the end of the twentieth century, still continue in their misdeeds, their domination and savage exploitation of peoples and of the abundant natural riches of Namibia and Zimbabwe."}
{"text": "Thus the minority and illegal racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia have resorted to all sorts of lies and tricks, such as the rigged election farce and the establishment of puppet regimes."}

{"text": "36.\tOver the last 12 months, the world has noted with indignation the multifarious alliances formed by the imperialists and international reactionaries for purposes of infiltration in all regions of the world in order to provoke dissension and to sow discord among peoples."}
{"text": "To carry out their policy of domination and expansionism, the imperialists and reactionaries do not hesitate to provoke conflicts and engage in armed aggression."}
{"text": "37.\tThus, in South-East Asia the international reactionaries, flouting the elementary norms of international law and the traditional conduct of nations, have become embroiled in a wide-scale armed aggression against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which they have accused of having assisted the heroic people of Kampuchea, threatened with extermination, in overthrowing their tyrants."}
{"text": "Since then protests such as ' 'Hands off Viet Nam\" have been made on the international scene and recently, during the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries, thanks were expressed to Viet Nam and support was offered for its firm resolve to safeguard and to build up its beloved homeland and for its active participation in the work of national independence and peace among the peoples of the world."}
{"text": "But, notwithstanding the universal condemnation of the aforementioned aggression, the international reactionaries have continued to display an arrogant attitude stating that they would teach Viet Nam a \"second lesson\" if they deemed it necessary."}

{"text": "39.\tAs things stand as regards my country, the champions of reactionary power in Peking, through their manoeuvres and hostile acts, oppose the revolutionary work of the Lao people."}
{"text": "They have massed several divisions of troops along our borders; they have sent spies and pirates to Laos, provoked constant disturbances, sown subversion, brought about division among the ethnic minorities of Laos and gathered together all the exiled Lao reactionary exiles into a trumped-up \"Lao Socialist Party\"."}

{"text": "Worse yet, in order to conceal their dark and evil designs, they have, under the fallacious pretext of \"taking in refugees\", on the one hand, goaded young people from Laos to flee their homeland and to become refugees, and, on the other hand, attracted to south China several thousands of former soldiers and people who are hated by progressive Lao society and who had sought refuge in Thailand."}
{"text": "184.\tAt the same time, they have deployed enormous efforts to sap the friendship and solidarity existing between Laos and Viet Nam and between Laos, Viet Nam and Kampuchea in the hope of weakening those three countries and of making preparations for the eventual overthrow of the new regime in our country."}

{"text": "201.\tThe gap between the developed countries and the developing countries becomes ever wider."}
{"text": "This situation, which cannot last much longer without endangering international peace and security, is a result, as we all know too well, of the persistence of the unjust basis on which international economic relations rest."}
{"text": "These relations, characterized by dependence, exploitation and inequality, have shown themselves for a long time now of being incapable of stimulating the development of under-developed countries and contributing to the elimination of their economic and social ills, which were engendered by centuries of colonial, neo-colonial and imperialist exploitation."}
{"text": "202.\tIn order to remedy that serious situation, the sixth special session of the General Assembly, which met in 1974, examined the problem of international economic development in all its aspects, and adopted by consensus a Declaration and a Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order that would be more just and more equitable."}
{"text": "Five years have elapsed since the adoption of those texts, and the economic situation of the developing countries, far from improving, has continually grown worse."}
{"text": "However, despite this highly disturbing fact, negotiations have proceeded within the United Nations and in various specialized bodies to implement measures which have been advocated to establish the new international economic order; but the results have been meagre be-cause of the lack of political will on the part of most of the developed market-economy countries, which are hanging on to their vested privileges."}
{"text": "The recent failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD, held in Manila last May, is a perfect demonstration of that point."}
{"text": "203.\tIt is imperative, in the interests of balanced and harmonious development of all countries, both developed and developing, as well as in the interests of safeguarding international peace and security, that the developed market-economy countries put an end to their dilatory practices and adopt a policy of real effective co-operation with the developing countries."}

{"text": "152.\tThe United Kingdom of Libya, in its fervent desire for the creation and maintenance of world conditions conducive to lasting peace, has observed the deterioration in the international situation over the last few months with grave anxiety."}
{"text": "The failure of the Paris Summit Conference, which collapsed before it began, blighted all men\u2019s hopes that the two opposing blocs which now cover two large sections of the world' s surface, would have an opportunity of trying to put their relations on a more normal footing, find the right solutions to their disputes and thus usher in the era of harmony and understanding required for the maintenance of international peace and security."}

{"text": "158.\tInasmuch as its major concern is to defend its territorial Integrity, Independence and national sovereignty and to preserve its ideals, its traditions and its spiritual and national values, the United Kingdom of Libya is doing everything in its power to maintain the friendliest relations with the western Powers and the most correct and normal relations with the eastern Powers."}
{"text": "These relations are based on mutual respect and understanding, in order to protect the interests of both sides and further international co-operation."}
{"text": "This is how Libya proves its heartfelt desire to work dispassionately and with an unprejudiced mind for understanding and harmony, as is implicit in honest acceptance of the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations, for the sake of an improvement in international relations."}
{"text": "I would add that Libya's international relations are governed above all by its resolve to work tirelessly for the triumph of the principles of self-determination, dignity and freedom in the interests of world peace and tranquillity."}

{"text": "The principles and resolutions of Bandung, Accra, Monrovia, Addis Ababa and, more recently, of Leopoldville, bear eloquent testimony to the solidarity of the independent countries of Asia and Africa and to their common desire to work together for the greater moral and material well-being of their peoples."}

{"text": "161.\tLibya has worked hard to establish the close and most cordial relations with its brother Arab States."}
{"text": "These relations are based on a common belief in brotherhood, friendship, mutual respect and the fulfilment of a common destiny."}
{"text": "Libya is therefore committed to working with the other Arab States to Strengthen co-operation for the good of all, to maintain peace and tranquillity in the whole region and to spread understanding of the obligations of good neighbourliness."}
{"text": "Because of its geographical position, Libya is playing its natural role as a link between the eastern and western parts of the Arab world."}
{"text": "Libya folly understands the importance of this role, and has endeavoured to maintain cordial relations and ties of brotherhood with all Arab countries."}
{"text": "162.\tIn order to attain these ends more systematically and effectively, Libya joined the League of Arab States, immediately after gaining its independence."}
{"text": "Within this regional organization, Libya loyally and consistently faces its responsibilities and fulfils its obligations, in the firm conviction that it is thus working for greater unity among the Arab peoples in the future and for ever more fruitful cooperation between member States in all fields in order to make the region more prosperous and to raise its inhabitants\u2019 level of living."}
{"text": "The League of Arab States is a regional organization dedicated to the maintenance of peace and security."}
{"text": "As such, and because of its efforts to enable the region to develop in every way and of its achievements in spreading the principles of the United Nations, the League of Arab States deserves to be recognized as a regional agency, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter dealing with regional arrangements."}
{"text": "163.\tOne of the essential reasons for instability and tension in the eastern part of the Arab world, the Near East, is that the principles of the United Nations and successive resolutions of the General Assembly have been trampled underfoot, and that those who perpetrated the aggression against the Arab homeland in Palestine continue to hurl defiance most arrogantly at the international Organization."}
{"text": "The tragic result is that over a million Palestine Arab refugees, Christian and Muslim, have been living, since the assault on their homeland, in the most appalling conditions of exile, poverty and hardship."}
{"text": "The land of their ancestors, their homes and their fields were despoiled by foreign invaders, 164.\t"}
{"text": "That was the most painful episode in human history, when the most unpardonable crimes were committed against the fundamental right of human communities to protection against mass expulsion by methods of banditry and terror, and when the sacred right to private property and to the enduring existence of one\u2019s country were scandalously violated."}
{"text": "Pending the attainment of a just and equitable solution capable of repairing the indescribable wrongs done to the Palestine refugees and to their country and permitting them to go back to their homes, their fields and their native land in accordance with the resolutions of the General Assembly, it is of the highest importance that the United Nations should continue to assume responsibility for the Palestine refugees and to provide them generously with the material and moral help they need."}
{"text": "165.\tThe Arabs in occupied Palestine are subjected to the most excessive extortions and extraordinary legislation."}
{"text": "In the Negev, they are the victims of unjust measures which threaten their very existence."}

{"text": "Everyone has been gladly proclaiming from this rostrum that 1960 is the year of Africa."}
{"text": "That is true in so far as it is admitted that 1960 can and must be the year in which the United Nations, convinced of the justice and legitimacy of Africa\u2019s aspirations to dignity and freedom, decides to espouse Africa\u2019s cause once and for all, and to intervene in order to root out altogether the causes of the evils which are shaking and troubling it."}
{"text": "The Africa of 1960 is the Africa of victimized and despised Algeria, which is malting heavy sacrifices to recover its dignity and freedom to choose its own destiny and is heroically facing injustice, terror and inhuman repression by colonialist aggressors."}
{"text": "The Africa of 1960 is that of the African people of South Africa in revolt against segregation and racial discrimination and undergoing savage repression for the simple reason that it is claiming its natural right to live on its African land in dignity and equality."}
{"text": "The Africa of 1960 is the Congo tom apart, mutilated and thrown into chaos, and undergoing physical suffering to protect its newly acquired national independence, its unity and territorial integrity which are threatened by manoeuvres and intrigues."}
{"text": "The Africa of 1960 is that of numerous African peoples still dependent and often oppressed, who claim the enjoyment of their natural right to self-determination and to liberation from the yoke of foreign occupation and rule."}
{"text": "167.\t"}
{"text": "I should now like to present briefly the views of the Libyan Government on these questions which, in our opinion, place this year of Africa in its true, but unhappily tragic, context."}
{"text": "Hard by our Western borders, the war, more deadly than ever, is still raging in Algeria."}
{"text": "To the heavy and sinister toll of victims of military operations on both sides must be added the unspeakable sufferings and miseries of the civilian population which is subjected to extortion, arbitrary treatment, repression and revenge."}
{"text": "More than two million Algerians, uprooted and displaced, are living herded together in reassembly camps under the most distressing conditions."}
{"text": "Hundreds of thousands of refugees have been forced to seek shelter in neighbouring countries, Tunisia, Libya and Morocco, leaving behind them their villages in ruins and their fields laid waste."}
{"text": "But the Algerian people is steadfastly determined, in the face of these injustices and privations, to stake its all and to meet every obstacle with fortitude in order to assert its natural and legitimate right to live in its own country in freedom, dignity and independence."}
{"text": "Nothing can stop the Algerians in their march towards liberation."}
{"text": "Moreover, the frightful war waged by France in Algeria is a grave threat to peace in Africa and seriously hinders the development of the young neighbouring countries whose security and tranquillity it disturbs."}
{"text": "168.\t"}
{"text": "This session of the General Assembly is the sixth successive session during which the Algerian question has been the subject of a full-scale debate within the United Nations."}
{"text": "Each time, the advocates of a certain doctrine put forward the prudent advice that It was absolutely essential to give the two parties concerned the opportunity to settle their differences and that United Nations Intervention would tend to obstruct a generous solution of this problem by France."}
{"text": "This way of thinking is in fact nothing but a reflection, whether involuntary or engineered, of French tactics, which each time have merely sought to gain time in the hope of stifling the Algerian nationalist revolt by force of arms and dealing a decisive blow to check the urge towards liberation which has aroused the whole of Algeria."}
{"text": "169.\tFor our part, while explaining over and over again that the Algerian revolt was an irrevocable decision of the Algerian people, we have constantly recommended that it was the duly of the United Nations to intervene seriously and positively with a view to enabling France and fighting Algeria to arrive, under United Nations auspices, at a peaceful negotiated solution of the Algerian conflict in the overriding interest of peace and in the ultimate interest of France itself."}
{"text": "We were all the more emphatic in putting forward this view at the last session because we thought that an encouraging starting-point had finally been reached, namely the agreement of both parties on the right to self-determination as the basis of a negotiated settlement for the restoration of peace in Algeria."}
{"text": "This starting-point, we thought, gave the United Nations the desired opportunity to throw the weight of its authority into the balance in order to provide the necessary means for the consultation of the Algerian people on their ultimate destiny in conditions of freedom and with all due safeguards."}
{"text": "170.\tSome delegations, well-intentioned, certainly, but unfortunately ill-informed as to our tragic and bitter African realities, were convinced by the persistence, not to say the intrigues, of those who loudly proclaimed that any intervention by the United Nations, whatever form it took, would be both ill-timed and dangerous, and that this time France must be given the opportunity to find her own solution for the Algerian conflict."}
{"text": "It was therefore impossible to adopt a resolution which quite simply expressed universally accepted fact, that is to say, the recognition of the right of the Algerian people to self-determination and an appeal for \"pourparlers\" for the purpose of finding a peaceful solution based on the right to self-determination in accordance with the principles of the United Nations."}
{"text": "Representatives will remember the strange circumstances of the vote on a draft resolution which, after gaining the requisite two-thirds majority in the voting on separate paragraphs, did not obtain the same majority when voted upon as a whole."}
{"text": "171.\tBut the evolution of the Algerian question during 1960, the year of Africa, has clearly shown the futility and danger of the wise and prudent advice that the United Nations should not intervene and that France should be given an opportunity to find the desired solution to the conflict."}
{"text": "172.\tIt may be worth while to review these developments briefly."}
{"text": "In accepting the principle of self-determination as the basis for a peaceful solution of the Algerian problem, the provisional government of the Algerian Republic insisted that it was essential to ensure its fair and loyal implementation."}
{"text": "To this end, it offered to enter into \"pourparlers\" with the French Government with a view to determining the conditions of a cease-fire as well as the necessary safeguards for the honest and genuine execution of a free consultation."}
{"text": "At the same time, it appointed a delegation to begin the \"pourparlers\"."}
{"text": "173.\tThe provisional government of the Algerian Republic explained clearly that it had no intention of negotiating about the political destiny of Algeria, but would leave the decision on that subject to a vote by the Algerian people."}
{"text": "174.\tNot only did France refuse categorically to enter into discussion with the appointed representatives of the provisional government of the Algerian Republic, but French leaders, including General de Gaulle himself during his famous \"tour of the mess halls\" after the tumultuous riots at Algiers in January I960, stated clearly that France alone would determine the conditions of the referendum, even adding that the French Army would supervise the future elections!"}
{"text": "175.\tWithout losing heart, and in spite of the deadlock caused by the French Government\u2019s attitude, the provisional government of the Algerian Republic has constantly asserted that it was anxious to enter into negotiations at any time with France with a view to settling the conditions for a cease-fire and to reach a peaceful negotiated solution of the Algerian conflict."}
{"text": "176.\tNot wishing to let slip any opportunity of putting an end to the conflict and finding a definitive solution, the provisional government of the Algerian Republic sent an affirmative reply to the invitation which General de Gaulle finally decided to send it on 14 June 1960, that is, only a few months before the opening of the General Assembly session."}
{"text": "177.\tOn 20 June, the provisional government of the Algerian Republic announced that it had decided to send a delegation led by Mr. Ferhat Abbas to meet General de Gaulle and was instructing two emissaries, Mr. Boumendjel and Mr. Ben Yahia, to go to Paris to prepare for the Algerian delegation\u2019s journey."}
{"text": "Thus, from 25 to 29 June 1960, at Melun, the first official meeting was held between the accredited representatives of the two parties to the Algerian conflict."}
{"text": "This gave rise to a ray of hope; a large section of French opinion favouring peace and the Algerian nationalists as well as the peoples of the whole world, could dare to hope that the process of restoring peace in Algeria was beginning."}
{"text": "Unfortunately, the world, anxiously awaiting the end of these preliminary discussions, was soon to be sadly disappointed."}
{"text": "On 29 June, the French Government issued a communique stating peremptorily that its representatives - had made known the conditions under which \"pourparlers\" could be arranged."}
{"text": "This high-handed and intransigent attitude taken by the French Government was tantamount, in the circumstances in which the Algerian side was situated, to a refusal to negotiate."}
{"text": "All the proposals and suggestions put forward by the Algerian emissaries were categorically rejected."}
{"text": "Under the conditions stipulated by France, the Algerian delegation would have been in a position totally incompatible with honour, freedom and dignity, that is to say, incompatible with the status of negotiator."}
{"text": "178.\tOn 4 July 1960, the provisional government of the Algerian Republic issued a communique in which it explained the reasons for the failure of the preliminary conversations at Melun and clearly demonstrated the French Government\u2019s responsibility in the matter."}
{"text": "But it left the door open, and asked only that the conditions should be compatible with the principle of negotiation."}
{"text": "179.\t"}
{"text": "The whole world Was then expecting to see General de Gaulle intervene with a noble gesture to save the situation in accordance with the demands of realism and good sense."}
{"text": "Unfortunately, in his statements during his tours of the French provinces."}
{"text": "General de Gaulle confirmed France\u2019s position as announced at Melun."}
{"text": "His subsequent statements on the Algerian question have been no more helpful to the process, which had seemed about to begin, of moving towards a negotiated settlement of the conflict."}
{"text": "What is worse, the French Government has initiated a process of so-called evolution in Algeria by means of Commissions d\u2019\u00e9lus, (Commissions of Elected Persons) under a system of French administration far removed from the real will of the Algerian people."}
{"text": "This policy can only result in complicating the situation in Algeria still further."}
{"text": "180.\tThis discouraging development led the provisional government of the Algerian Republic to draw the obvious conclusions."}
{"text": "On 22 August 1960 it announced: \"The provisional government of the Algerian Republic has taken note of General de Gaulle\u2019s refusal to negotiate on the conditions and safeguards for a free consultation of the Algerian people."}
{"text": "French policy is depriving self-determination of all democratic content and seeks to impose by force a status which would tend to \u2019Balkanize\u2019 Algeria."}
{"text": "In these circumstances, the provisional government of the Algerian Republic considers that the consultation of the Algerian people must be conducted by means of a referendum organized and supervised by the United Nations.\u201d"}
{"text": "181.\t"}
{"text": "The war in Algeria has cost too dear in victims and in misery."}
{"text": "The sons of Algeria and of France are felling in thousands in this senseless and futile war which France is waging against the Algerian people."}
{"text": "The war is continually increasing the threat to peace in Africa in particular and in the world in general."}
{"text": "In the awakening African continent, the danger is that it will spread, with incalculable consequences for the future of Africa\u2019s relations with the Western world."}
{"text": "It is time, therefore, that the United Nations felly shouldered its responsibilities and settled once and for all the difficulties preventing the sound implementation of the principle of self-determination for the Algerian people, by means of a referendum organized and supervised by the international Organization."}
{"text": "It is also time for the allies and friends of France, if there is to be any meaning in calling this year \"the year of Africa\", to bring their authority and influence to bear in favour of settling the Algerian question through the arbitration of the United Nations."}
{"text": "Otherwise it will be too late to win the friendship of the African peoples, who are bound to draw inferences from what is liable to be regarded as proof of complicity and connivance on the part of the Western leaders and their henchmen in what is called the free world."}
{"text": "182.\tOnly a few days ago."}
{"text": "President Eisenhower said in his remarkable speech, which was largely devoted to Africa: \"In the developing areas, we must seek to promote peaceful change as well as to assist economic and social progress."}
{"text": "To do this \u2014 to assist peaceful change \u2014 the international community must be able to manifest its presence in emergencies through United Nations observers or forces.\""}
{"text": "[868th meeting, para."}
{"text": "50.J 183.\t"}
{"text": "If there is any region in Africa where peaceful change ought to be promoted and where there is a typical case of emergency, it is certainly Algeria."}
{"text": "This is an additional reason for the United Nations to take its responsibilities in the Algerian crisis seriously."}
{"text": "184.\tNow that France has recognized the Algerian people\u2019s right to self-determination, the competence of the United Nations in the matter and its duty to help in arriving at a peaceful solution of this conflict can no longer be in the slightest doubt, either in the realm of law or in that of political expediency."}
{"text": "185.\tOn this point Mr. Gabriel Marcel, a distinguished member of the Institut de France, commented, in an article entitled \"Splendid Isolation\" published by the newspaper Le Monde on 27 September 1960: \"There is one observation to be made."}
{"text": "Are not our opponents, and even our friends, justified in saying that there is a contradiction between admitting the right of the Algerians to self-determination and declaring that the Algerian question is a domestic matter?"}
{"text": "It is difficult to see, in fact, how these two propositions can be reconciled."}
{"text": "To speak of a purely domestic matter is to say that Algeria is a French province, and in that case it is no more entitled to recognition of the right to self-determination than is Brittany or Provence."}
{"text": "\"To admit that right, on the other hand, is to acknowledge that Algeria cannot be likened to a French province, and in that case the claims of the United Nations no longer appear inadmissible."}
{"text": "Quibbles designed to evade this dilemma will convince no one.\" 186.\t"}
{"text": "While voicing the absolute and unfailing support of Libya for, the Algerian people in their heroic Struggle to realize their national aspirations, I should like to express once again the most fervent hope that through United Nations arbitration a new era will dawn in the relations between France and an Algeria which has freely and genuinely determined its own policy so that these relations may be based on renewed friendship, mutual respect and truly fruitful cooperation."}
{"text": "187.\t"}
{"text": "The deterioration of the situation in the Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville) causes Libya the gravest concern."}
{"text": "The Libyan Government, which severely condemned Belgium\u2019s military intervention in the Congo, considers that it was the ensuing secessionist movements which plunged the new State into the maelstrom of difficulties now besetting it and created serious threats to its unity and territorial integrity."}
{"text": "188.\tActuated by feelings of fraternal solidarity with this new African State, Libya hastened to offer everything in its power and within the limits of its capabilities to assist the United Nations in the fulfilment of its responsibilities in the Congo."}
{"text": "The Libyan delegation wishes to assure the United Nations and the Central Government of the Republic of the Congo of Libya\u2019s desire to give its unconditional support and make its contribution in keeping with the true national aspirations of the Congolese people."}
{"text": "The people and the Government of Libya, while affirming the necessity of preserving the Congo\u2019s unity and territorial integrity."}
{"text": "wish to assure the Central Government of the Republic of the Congo of their fullest solidarity and to express the hope that all the Congolese leaders will realize the urgency of doing everything possible to safeguard unity, mutual understanding and co-operation in the higher interests of the Congo and of Africa as a whole."}
{"text": "This is the only way to protect their young homeland from secessionist threats and neocolonialist machinations designed to dismember it."}
{"text": "189.\tIt is in that spirit that Libya took part in the work of the recent African Conference at Leopoldville and gave its full endorsement to the resolutions adopted there, with the overriding aim of ensuring African solidarity and world peace."}
{"text": "Also in conformity with this attitude, and in order to give, full support to the Central Government of the Republic of the Congo, the United Kingdom of Libya will do all it can to help carry out the provisions of the resolution [1474 (ES-IV)] adopted at the end of the fourth emergency special session recently devoted to consideration of the Congo crisis by the General Assembly."}
{"text": "190.\tLibya is deeply concerned at the explosive situation in the Union of South Africa."}
{"text": "The systematic policy of segregation and racial discrimination exalted into a \"raison d\u2019\u00e9tat\" by the Union Government, the domination exercised by a minority of whites over an overwhelming majority of Africans and the denial of fundamental human liberties constitute a grave danger to the peaceful evolution of the southern part of the African continent and for harmonious coexistence in a multiracial society."}
{"text": "191.\tBeing profoundly attached to the fundamental freedoms of the human person and to the innate right of Africans to live in liberty and dignity on the soil of their ancestors, Libya considers that the present situation in South Africa, besides involving the most flagrant violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, constitutes a grave threat to peace and security, not to mention the alarming international frictions to which it is continually giving rise."}
{"text": "We all remember the dramatic situation created last spring by the wholesale killings of unarmed populations, who were peacefully demonstrating against the violation of their elementary right to move about freely in their own country."}
{"text": "There is a more pressing need than ever for the General Assembly to devote its most earnest attention to the question of \"apartheid\" in South Africa, and to recommend measures as effective as possible, including the appropriate sanctions, if necessary, to put an end, during this year of Africa, to the most flagrant violations of the elementary liberties of Africans in their own African territory."}
{"text": "192.\t"}
{"text": "The Libyan delegation will follow with the greatest interest and with close attention the discussion of the questions relating to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, in the hope that the General Assembly will find a speedy solution in conformity with the right of peoples to self-determination."}

{"text": "The Libyan delegation profoundly regrets that the Ten-Nation Committee on Disarmament was not able to continue its, work."}
{"text": "We consequently consider it extremely important that the United Nations continue its efforts, undismayed and unwearying, to bring about the resumption of international negotiations for a constructive solution, under the aegis of the United Nations, leading to general and complete disarmament under effective international control."}

{"text": "The Libyan delegation hopes that the suspension, and later the final prohibition of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, besides protecting mankind from total destruction, will usher in an era when atomic energy will be used solely for peaceful purposes, 195.\tIt is nevertheless very regrettable that France, in spite of friendly pleadings, protests, condemnation and appeals by the United Nations, should have persisted in carrying out the first atomic tests in the heart of Africa."}

{"text": "The majority have made progress on some of the Goals  but not in others, or have made advances whose  benefits have been distributed very unequally among  different segments of the population.    "}
{"text": "In addition, today\u2019s international environment is  far less encouraging than that of 10 years ago."}
{"text": "The  previous decade began with the attack on the twin  towers in this very city, placing counter-terrorism  squarely as a priority on the international agenda."}
{"text": "It  continued with a military confrontation that was not  sanctioned by the Security Council, with all its  consequences, and concluded with three simultaneous  crises \u2014 food, energy and, especially, financial and  economic \u2014 from whose effects we have yet to recover.    "}
{"text": "Further, after building up a cumulative body of  scientific evidence that no longer allows any room for  doubt, we have confirmed that the very effects of  technological progress have brought with them  devastating consequences for our common habitat \u2014  this planet \u2014 and that the destruction wrought by  climate change is palpable and dramatic."}
{"text": "On another  matter, in the current decade we have witnessed very  clearly that organized crime does not recognize borders  and tends to spread to those countries with the least  capacity to confront its considerable resources.   "}
{"text": "My own country has been a victim of some of  these phenomena, which nullify or at least mitigate the  considerable efforts we have deployed, especially since  the Administration of President Colom took office  early in 2008, to stimulate development, achieve higher  levels of well-being for the disadvantaged sectors of our  population, and strengthen our democratic institutions.  "}
{"text": "Here again we see both light and shadow: in spite of an  unfavourable international environment and as President  Colom noted in this very Hall on 20 September, we have  achieved progress is addressing some of the pressing  problems faced by the our country\u2019s most vulnerable.    "}
{"text": "But the shadow is still present."}
{"text": "Its origin lies in  phenomena that are totally or partially out of our  control."}
{"text": "I highlight three of them."}
{"text": "First, the financial  and economic crisis had a sharp adverse impact on our  economic performance."}
{"text": "Gross national product grew  less than 1 per cent in 2009, with declining exports,  shrinking family remittances and collapsing foreign  direct investment."}
{"text": "This had an extremely negative  impact on our tax revenues, in spite of the many  Government initiatives to raise tax rates to deal with  increasing demands for social services and public  security."}
{"text": "Although we have seen a modest recovery this  year, its strength will depend to a large degree on  uncertain developments in the international economy.  "}
{"text": "In other words, the international economic environment  has not been very conducive to meeting our economic  growth goals, in spite of the official cooperation that  we have received, which we sincerely appreciate.   "}
{"text": "Secondly, in the last decade a array of unlawful  activities related to organized crime have taken root in  our country."}
{"text": "Trafficking in persons, arms and narcotics,  and money laundering have expanded to a worrisome  extent, given the dual abilities of organized criminal  groups to co-opt and intimidate."}
{"text": "Above all, drug  trafficking has undermined our democratic institutions.  "}
{"text": "In response, we have associated ourselves with the  United Nations and friendly countries, through both  bilateral and multilateral cooperation."}
{"text": "This can be seen  mostly clearly in the International Commission against  Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), to which I will return  later."}
{"text": "Furthermore, recognizing that the struggle against  illegal activities and organized crime \u2014 a basic  responsibility of all States \u2014 has today assumed a  clearly transnational character, we have joined our  neighbours in Central America and Mexico in  combating regional criminal networks.   "}
{"text": "Thirdly, as if what I have already said were not  enough, we have also fallen victim to natural disasters  with an unusual frequency, which highlights the  extreme vulnerability of Guatemala to the effects of  climate change, given its location in a tropical area."}
{"text": "We  had not even begun to recover from the effects of  tropical storm Stan of late 2005 when we were hit by a  serious drought in 2009 and, over the past few months,      41 10-55276    the eruption of the Pacaya Volcano, which caused  extensive damage to agriculture, followed by tropical  storm Agatha in June, which affected some 330,000  persons, killed approximately 100 and caused material  damage totalling an estimated $1 billion."}
{"text": "These  estimates in human suffering and material losses have  continued to grow with the unprecedented levels of  rainfall during the past month, which has contributed  even more human victims and material damage.   "}
{"text": "The Government has done all within its power to  address the situation and has appealed for international  assistance."}
{"text": "I commend the fact that the United Nations  was among the first to respond to our call, and I  therefore express our appreciation to the Office for the  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the  Administrator of the United Nations Development  Programme.   "}
{"text": "To date, we have been focused on the emergency  phase, but it is imperative that we move on to  reconstruction and recovery as soon as possible."}
{"text": "The  Government has drawn up a detailed plan to address  those goals, and we will convene an international  conference to present the plan to our partners in  Antigua in Guatemala on 11 and 12 October.   "}
{"text": "I shall now make some brief remarks on our  Organization and its agenda in the immediate future."}
{"text": "I  begin by reiterating our support for multilateralism in  general and for the United Nations in particular."}
{"text": "We  have enjoyed strong, continuous support from the  Organization, in supporting our peace process,  facilitating development cooperation and providing  assistance when we have faced emergencies, as at the  present time.   "}
{"text": "The latest example of that fruitful and innovative  cooperation is the International Commission against  Impunity in Guatemala."}
{"text": "In only three years, the  Commission has shown that it is indeed possible to  combat impunity and strengthen the rule of law."}
{"text": "We  value this cooperative effort between the Government  of Guatemala and the United Nations, and we will  continue to support it.   "}
{"text": "We also value the work of our Organization in the  area of peacekeeping."}
{"text": "We have participated in several  operations, principally in Haiti and the Democratic  Republic of the Congo."}
{"text": "We support the work of the  United Nations in the area of peacebuilding, and we  hope to participate in the Peacebuilding Commission as  a full member as of next January.   "}
{"text": "We welcome the decision of the General  Assembly to establish the United Nations Entity for  Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, and  we are pleased that its first leader will be Ms. Michelle  Bachelet."}
{"text": "We also commit ourselves to continue  supporting initiatives aimed at achieving greater  system-wide coherence.   "}
{"text": "At the same time, we harbour the hope that, in the  coming year, some tangible progress will be made in  the long-delayed reform of the Security Council."}
{"text": "We  believe that it is crucial to provide greater legitimacy to  that body, which would benefit all of the main bodies  and the Organization overall."}
{"text": "In the meantime, we have  announced our candidature for one of the seats  allocated to our region in the Security Council for the  biennium 2012-2013, in the hope of continuing to  contribute to its work.   "}
{"text": "We reiterate our profound commitment to  achieving significant progress during the next  Conference of the Parties of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held  in Canc\u00fan."}
{"text": "We have participated actively in the  preparatory work, based on the understanding that  rarely has humanity faced a larger challenge that  affects all countries and communities on the planet.   "}
{"text": "In rejoining the Human Rights Council, we  reiterate our commitment to the full respect of human  rights in all their aspects, including the responsibility  to protect our respective populations from genocide,  war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against  humanity.   "}
{"text": "It is commonly held that without peace there can  be no development."}
{"text": "Promising signs have been seen in  various parts of the world, which, we hope, may lead to  the resolution of long-standing tensions."}
{"text": "We trust that  the direct negotiations recently begun in the Middle  East will be fruitful and lead to a Palestinian State that  can coexist with Israel in peace and harmony, within  borders that are secure for both parties.   "}
{"text": "We also applaud the engagement and growing  climate of cooperation being generated between the  parties separated by the Taiwan Straits.   "}
{"text": "Finally, I am pleased to announce that we have  achieved a major step forward in addressing the  International Court of Justice, together with Belize, to  seek a juridical solution to the age-old territorial  dispute between us."}
{"text": "That step required the approval by       10-55276 42    our Congress of the Special Agreement signed with  Belize in December 2008, which cleared the path for a  popular referendum, as provided for under that  Agreement."}
{"text": "We hope that the Belizean Parliament will  also authorize as soon as possible the referendum to be  held simultaneously in both countries, as the final step  that allows both parties to present themselves to the  Court."}
{"text": "Like others who have  spoken before me, allow me to add my warm  congratulations to Mr. Al-Nasser on his election as  President of the General Assembly for our current  session."}
{"text": "My delegation and I assure him, as always, of  our support and cooperation."}
{"text": "I also wish to thank  Mr. Joseph Diess of Switzerland for a successful term  as President at the sixty-fifth session."}
{"text": "We also  remember another former President of the Assembly,  Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, who passed away earlier  this year but who left a lasting impact on the good  work of the General Assembly and the United Nations.   "}
{"text": "As for the ongoing leadership of the  Organization, I wish to extend my congratulations to  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to  a deserved second term."}
{"text": "He and the Secretariat  continue to show the firm resolve needed during these  challenging times of global crisis."}
{"text": "We pay tribute also  to the memory of those members of the Secretariat who  have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of  international duty.   "}
{"text": "A further example of the critical role played by  the Secretary-General during these difficult times was the  convening earlier this week of the High-level Meeting on  the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases  (NCDs)."}
{"text": "The dangerous potential of NCDs, unchecked  in small States like mine, threatens not just livelihoods  and lifestyle but whatever gains may have been  achieved as they relate to Millennium Development  Goal (MDG) 6 and the other MDGs.   "}
{"text": "At our annual meeting of Pacific Island Forum  leaders in Auckland earlier this month, we adopted a  statement on NCDs in which, among other things, we  committed our Governments to implementing five key  interventions in areas known to reduce NCDs:  Controlling tobacco, improving diets, increasing  physical activity, reducing alcohol intake and  facilitating access to essential drugs and technologies.

{"text": "17 11-51372     "}
{"text": "In that respect, Tonga was pleased to join other  Member States in adopting the Political Declaration  (resolution 66/2, annex) of the High-level Meeting on  the prevention and control of NCDS."}
{"text": "I sincerely  believe that the Meeting was a good step in the right  direction for setting a healthier and enjoyable future  for us all.   "}
{"text": "We were pleased that the Secretary-General was  able to visit a number of countries in our region on his  way to his historic attendance at the Pacific Islands  Forum."}
{"text": "He was able to assess for himself the dominant  impact of climate change on countries in the Pacific  and to validate the activities of Pacific small island  developing States like Tonga in international forums.  "}
{"text": "We must use the positive foundations laid down  collectively in Copenhagen and Canc\u00fan to embrace the  promise that might lie in Durban at the seventeenth  Conference of the Parties to the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change in  December.   "}
{"text": "We are pleased that, in July, under the able  presidency of Germany, the Security Council took solid  steps to seize the moral imperative by holding an open  debate and producing a presidential statement on the  Maintenance of international peace and security and  the impact of climate change (S/PRST/2011/15*)."}
{"text": "The  Council and its membership, now and in the future,  must not turn from their vigilant duty to keep  themselves in a position of leadership over this issue  and its implications for Member States like Tonga and  others in the Pacific.   "}
{"text": "While last year\u2019s High-level Meeting on MDGs  offered small island developing States like Tonga an  opportunity to take stock of their progress towards  achieving those Goals in 2015, we consider that we  have a similar chance to do so as we all prepare for the  United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  next year."}
{"text": "We stress the critical importance of the  sustainable development, management and conservation of  our ocean and marine resources \u2014 living and  non-living \u2014 as a proper source of livelihood and  income for our communities and Governments.  "}
{"text": "Ensuring that States like ours enjoy a greater share of  the benefits derived from such resources is key."}
{"text": "What  we within the Pacific small island developing States  have come to refer to as the \u201cblue economy\u201d will be  our challenge to the Rio Conference to meet the  expectations and development aspirations of our  peoples.   "}
{"text": "As such, Tonga continues to observe its  obligations under the United Nations Convention on  the Law of the Sea and notes the decision taken by  consensus by the States parties this year relating to the  workload of the Commission on the Limits of the  Continental Shelf, whose work is much valued by  coastal States such as mine."}
{"text": "Tonga, together with  another sister State from the region, again actively  participated in the work of the International Seabed  Authority this year and noted the decision by the  Authority to grant exploration licenses to entities  sponsored by our respective Governments."}
{"text": "This  represents a creative path for States like mine, within  the spirit of the Convention, towards solid partnership  and development."}
{"text": "The common heritage of mankind, if  it is to have any true meaning, ought to be common to  all and not just to some or the few with the capacity in  that area.   "}
{"text": "Tonga reiterates its call for the creation and  definition of a formal small island developing States  category within the United Nations system."}
{"text": "We are in  need of a definition that is not based upon a one-size- fits-all approach."}
{"text": "Like others, we must have a  definition that separates and addresses those States\u2019  diversity of size, population, remoteness, isolation and  different levels of socio-economic development."}
{"text": "Such a  definition would not only improve linkages within the  United Nations system but also, we believe, set a good  benchmark for the international community that is both  coherent and practical."}
{"text": "It would strengthen the position  of the United Nations and the international system in  addressing small island developing States and the  special and unique challenges they face.   "}
{"text": "Like others, we, too, welcome the Republic of  South Sudan as our newest State Member of the United  Nations."}
{"text": "Tonga has long been supportive of the efforts  to find a comprehensive, just and enduring peace in the  Middle East."}

{"text": "This is indeed a moment of truth for those with  genuine hope, not just for a secure Israel and a viable  Palestine, but for those who for so long have had such  hopes for an ambitious peace.   "}
{"text": "Tonga\u2019s interest in developing renewable energy  sources, within the context of our Tonga energy road  map, continued to evolve with our election to the  Council of the International Renewable Energy Agency       11-51372 18    (IRENA) at the first session of the Agency\u2019s Assembly,  in April 2011."}
{"text": "We will work in earnest to ensure that  the voices of developing States such as Tonga and  others on the new Council are heard, given the key  leading role it will play in the Agency\u2019s decision- making and future direction."}
{"text": "To take on such a role,  IRENA must be prepared to be innovative."}
{"text": "The  Agency\u2019s work will take on greater significance in the  coming International Year of Sustainable Energy for  All and its related activities."}

{"text": "I am pleased to have addressed the Assembly as  the first democratically elected Prime Minister of  Tonga."}
{"text": "In the wake of the elections held in November  of last year, I took office the following month, in  December, after an evolving process of principal  reforms that, within the context of our 1875  Constitution, included the peaceful transfer of  executive power from His Majesty in Privy Council to  the Government of the day; a Parliament in which the  majority of members are elected by universal suffrage;  a Prime Minister elected by a majority of the elected  Members of Parliament; a Cabinet nominated by the  Prime Minister and chosen largely from those elected  Members of Parliament; a constitutional monarchy;  and a strong and independent judiciary free of political  influence.

{"text": "It involves nine priority areas, from building  strong, inclusive communities to improving health and  education standards for a safe, secure and stable  Tongan society."}
{"text": "Earlier this month, my Government  signed separate agreements with the Asian  Development Bank and the World Bank to improve  information and communications technology services  for Tonga so as to make them affordable and  accessible."}
