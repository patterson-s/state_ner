{"text": "\ufeff1.\tI should like first to congratulate Mr. Paul Lusaka, of Zambia, on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly."}
{"text": "I am confident that under his leadership the work of the thirty-ninth session will produce positive results."}
{"text": "His election constitutes, to our great satisfaction, a further reflection of the outstanding role played by the Group of African States in the United Nations and its active contribution to the international community."}
{"text": "2.\tAt this session we have taken another step towards the universality of the United Nations with the admission of the 159th Member, Brunei Darussalam, to which Uruguay extends a most cordial and friendly welcome and offers its full co-operation."}
{"text": "3.\tIn the annual consideration of our agenda, we are faced with a full range of serious problems arising as a consequence of the world economic crisis and the continued existence of a large number of situations brought about by political tension and even by open conflict."}
{"text": "4.\tIn recent years, our world has not become safer, more peaceful or more just: quite the contrary."}
{"text": "151."}
{"text": "I should like to refer specifically to some of the questions that are particularly important to my Government."}
{"text": "152."}
{"text": "On the occasion of the opening of the twenty- fifth annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank, at Punta del Este in March of this year, President Alvarez underlined the fact that the opening of the session coincided with \"the most painful crisis of the world economic system\"."}
{"text": "He said: \"Latin America is undergoing the deepest crisis of the last half century."}
{"text": "Growth has stagnated."}
{"text": "The standard of living of every citizen has worsened in the whole region, thus bringing about the inevitable social and political consequences."}
{"text": "This situation of unforeseen regional and world-wide consequences is reflected in an unprecedented debt, the servicing and repayment of which constitutes a very high percentage of the export revenue, if not all of it."}
{"text": "\"In these conditions\u2014and we emphasize this\u2014 the problem cannot be solved."}
{"text": "Even if we recognize that the work of reconstruction is a responsibility falling on all the members of the community who wish to make progress, it becomes essential that credit institutions and developed countries accept their responsibilities, taking into account their own capabilities and political and financial interests."}
{"text": "Their own growth and stability depend in the end on the economic and social well-being of our countries.\""}
{"text": "He continued: \"The time has come to abandon sterile diagnoses and to undertake co-ordinated action."}
{"text": "The terms of payment of our debt must be rescheduled; reducing interest rates in such a way that the debt may be serviced while we keep a level of revenue-producing exports that can safeguard the social conditions of our peoples."}
{"text": "In order for Latin America to continue its development and generate wealth\u2014 and this seems to be everyone's goal\u2014we should be able to draw on sufficient external financing while at the same time increasing our exports.\""}
{"text": "153.\t"}
{"text": "Nevertheless, it must be said that, in assuming the responsibility of meeting our obligations and carrying out the relevant negotiations in a sovereign manner, the Latin American countries have found in their adverse situation a source of unity and co-operation."}
{"text": "154.\t"}
{"text": "In meetings at Quito, Lima, Cartagena and Mar del Plata, we have produced important documents which clearly articulate our strong and responsible common position, on the basis of which we are ready for a constructive dialogue."}
{"text": "We have firmly put forward just and realistic guidelines for the repayment of the debt, taking into account the unavoidable and equitable sacrifices that such adjustment entails for all parties concerned."}
{"text": "155.\tIn this context, we once again strongly support the provisions of paragraph 23 of the Cartagena Consensus, signed on 22 June 1984."}
{"text": "On that occasion, the majority of the Latin American countries expressed their readiness \"to hold a meeting with the Governments of industrialized countries in order to examine jointly the many aspects, and the economic, social and political implications, of the indebtedness of Latin America\"."}
{"text": "156.\tThe present situation, in all its gravity, confirms once more the wisdom of our long-standing position concerning the need to eliminate restrictions to trade which seriously affect the developing countries."}
{"text": "As exemplified by the present situation, one can claim the validity of the equation encompassing external debt and trade, but one must also accept, as has always been the case, the relationship between trade and development."}
{"text": "157.\tIn this perspective, the protectionism of the industrialized countries and their intervention in international markets with subsidized products constitute a very serious development, which adversely affects the developing countries not only at the economic level but also in the social context."}
{"text": "158.\tIt must be clearly stated that those countries which practise such conduct in matters so vital for the life of peoples and the regulation of their relationships have no moral legitimacy in passing judgement on other aspects of relationships among men, nor do they have the authority to question the political, social and economic consequences brought about by their actions."}
{"text": "159.\t"}
{"text": "The crisis produced by the external debt has also underlined the weaknesses of the international financial system, which are greatly increased by the relationship among all the factors."}
{"text": "160.\tIt is obvious that these problems affect not only Latin America in varying degrees, they affect all the developing countries and are added to the critical food situation, especially in Africa."}
{"text": "We have not reached the goal of food security."}
{"text": "We must continue our efforts to that end."}
{"text": "161.\tIt is sad to observe that the various multilateral mechanisms have not been able to deal with these issues\u2014as they have not been able to deal with financial and monetary questions\u2014in the depth that the situation requires or with the practical efficiency required."}
{"text": "We have not made any progress in the global negotiations, in the revision of the development strategy or in the adoption of immediate remedies."}
{"text": "We are facing an acute crisis in international co-operation to a degree which threatens not only the vitality of the multilateral mechanisms themselves but their very existence."}
{"text": "We are witnessing an acute crisis in international co-operation to such an extent that we note that it has become impossible to discuss and implement overall long- term policies such as would encompass a comprehensive solution to global problems."}
{"text": "162.\tWe think it is necessary to initiate immediate and concerted practical action to find solutions to the most pressing basic problems, such as those of trade, finance and the establishment of appropriate conditions of food security."}
{"text": "That would improve the standard of living of the developing countries in the immediate future."}
{"text": "163.\t"}
{"text": "The delegation of Uruguay is ready to cooperate actively in the search for multilateral remedies which could help to solve these problems."}
{"text": "We must, however, insist on our offer of honest cooperation, even though this might elicit a response only in terms of an echo of the words themselves."}
{"text": "Beyond rhetoric, it is necessary to enter into a genuine dialogue, to embark upon practical negotiations to solve pressing questions, and we must show the necessary political will."}
{"text": "The paralysis pervading the international scene on questions so vital and urgent for the daily life of peoples could become the factor triggering greater evils with unpredictable consequences."}
{"text": "164.\tFor 20 years, Uruguay has been advocating a legal and peaceful solution to the question of the Malvinas Islands, through dialogue and negotiation within the framework of the United Nations."}
{"text": "That has become more necessary than ever in the light of the tragic events of 1982 and in view of the continued tension and risk which this unresolved question entails."}
{"text": "Our Government welcomes the statements expressing the will to find a solution."}
{"text": "They should be translated into the immediate resumption of negotiations."}
{"text": "Uruguay's well-known solidarity with the aspirations of the Argentine Republic does not preclude us, together with other Latin American nations, from formulating the sincere desire for the reopening of negotiations."}
{"text": "165.\t"}
{"text": "Our Government has been following with great concern the development of the crisis in Central America."}
{"text": "Without wishing to enter into discussions or into ideological confrontations, I must say that it is very moving to see so many people who have suffered for such a long time."}
{"text": "The human dimension of the conflict engulfs everything and everyone."}
{"text": "This makes it imperative to have solidarity and effective action."}
{"text": "The efforts of the countries members of the Contadora Group in this respect deserve our strong support."}
{"text": "The Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America is a document inspired by the rich juridical and political traditions of Latin America."}
{"text": "The various instances of dialogue in the recent past are encouraging signs."}
{"text": "166.\tWe trust that the positive action of the Group will continue\u2014Uruguay will offer its firm support to that end\u2014in order that the remaining obstacles may be overcome."}
{"text": "It is necessary for us to engage in joint efforts, within the framework of international law, to ensure that the peoples of Central America are guaranteed the free exercise of self-determination, as a viable means for achieving and consolidating peace."}
{"text": "167.\tWith an issue so momentous as the one before us, the contribution of all the countries of the region affected by the crisis is essential."}
{"text": "We therefore appeal to them to exert their best efforts and to display the political will necessary to promote negotiation, and at the same time we appeal to them to refrain from any action contrary to that aim."}
{"text": "168.\t"}
{"text": "The situation in the Middle East continues to be a source of serious tension, not only for the region but also for international security."}
{"text": "169.\tEver since the founding of the United Nations, our country has supported the adoption of solutions that equitably take into account the rights and interests of all the parties in the region."}
{"text": "Consequently, Uruguay is in favour of the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and recognizes the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to the full exercise of self-determination and the right of all the States in the region, including Israel, to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries."}
{"text": "170.\tThe path leading to true and lasting peace requires solutions negotiated among all the parties concerned, with no one excluded, solutions that take the various elements of the question into account in a balanced and equitable manner and thus provide assurances to all the States in the region."}
{"text": "171.\tThe United Nations can, when the time comes, play r significant role in promoting negotiations, by pre ding an appropriate framework or supplementing their further development or implementation."}
{"text": "We support in particular the efforts of the Secretary-General and we encourage him to continue them."}
{"text": "172.\t"}
{"text": "With deep emotion we express our solidarity with Lebanon, and, at the same time, we make a very strong political statement of support for its sovereignty, integrity and independence."}
{"text": "Our country hopes that the Lebanese Government, with the support and respect of the international community, will begin to exercise its functions and powers effectively throughout its territory and that, in a climate of national concord, peace will be consolidated with the withdrawal of foreign forces."}
{"text": "173.\t"}
{"text": "The attention of the international community should also be focused on other serious issues which affect various areas and which, taken together, bear witness to the precarious state of peace in the world."}
{"text": "I am referring to, among other things, the prolonged conflict between Iraq and Iran and to the situations in Afghanistan, Kampuchea and Cyprus, as well as to the division and tension in the Korean peninsula."}
{"text": "174.\tIt is appropriate for me to recall the importance my country attaches to the question of the unification of Korea by means of an independent, peaceful solution."}
{"text": "This solution must be attained through dialogue and direct negotiation, without foreign interference, which would make possible the creation of conditions favourable to understanding between the parties as well as to the stability of the region."}
{"text": "Within that context, the good offices of the Secretary-General, between North and South Korea, should be supported and encouraged."}
{"text": "The United Nations must not and cannot be indifferent to, or allow itself to be kept on the sidelines of this problem."}
{"text": "In addition, notwithstanding these efforts and in this spirit, membership of the two Koreas in the United Nations could constitute a very positive occurrence."}
{"text": "175.\tThe persistence of tension in southern Africa gives rise to particular concern."}
{"text": "There can be no doubt that the independence of Namibia and the exercise by its people of the right to self-determination have been postponed for far too long."}
{"text": "It is necessary to adopt collective measures designed to secure, in that area, the application of international law, as recognized by the International Court of Justice, the Security Council and the General Assembly."}
{"text": "Our Government actively supports the Secretariat's efforts to ensure implementation of internationally agreed norms in this respect."}
{"text": "The Security Council can make a decisive contribution, taking into account its own powers."}
{"text": "176.\tThe situation with respect to apartheid is one about which Uruguay has particularly strong feelings."}
{"text": "We totally reject this policy as well as its doctrine, its constitutional enshrinement and its practical application."}
{"text": "We fully endorse the recent Security Council resolution which declares that the new constitution of South Africa is contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and that its implementation would aggravate an already explosive situation in regard to apartheid."}
{"text": "177."}
{"text": "Within the framework of international law, our country firmly supports all actions aimed at putting an end to the policy of apartheid, the continued practice of which, moreover, is a danger to peace and security."}
{"text": "178."}
{"text": "Our reference to these questions makes it imperative for us to reaffirm our commitment to the defence of the principles of self-determination and non-discrimination on the basis of sex or religion or on any other basis, as well as to the application of both principles everywhere."}
{"text": "It is thus appropriate for us to express regret at the persistence of colonial situations, the continued implementation of discriminatory policies and the non-exercise of the right to self-determination."}
{"text": "179.\tUruguay, in accordance with a tradition by which it has always abided, considers that multilateral legal instruments are the most effective means for safeguarding and promoting human rights."}
{"text": "That is why it is desirable for these instruments to be made universal and for existing machinery to be put into effect."}
{"text": "It would be appropriate\u2014always bearing in mind the sovereign decision of each State\u2014to encourage, on the part of all Governments, greater accession to and ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, as well as the International Covenants on Human Rights and the Optional Protocol."}
{"text": "With regard to draft texts, we support the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, designed to abolish the death penalty, and the draft convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."}
{"text": "180.\tSince those instruments constitute a system for the protection of human rights, in keeping with the principles of impartiality and non-selectivity, and since they cover equally the weak and the powerful and every ideology and regime, their adoption would ensure genuine protection of fundamental rights."}
{"text": "If they are not adopted, in many instances it will continue to be only those who are more powerful that will benefit and only their political and economic interests will be protected, to the detriment of the interests of those who are weaker and the interests of certain parts of the world."}
{"text": "It will indeed run counter to the aims for which these instruments were drafted and, what is worse, they will benefit those who energetically uphold particular philosophical positions that claim to be universal and who will become apostles of discrimination."}
{"text": "181.\tThe strengthening, through the Secretariat, of the procedures of the Centre for Human Rights and the establishment of a post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights could contribute to ensuring the enjoyment of human rights without distortion and in a truly constructive manner."}
{"text": "182.\tThe increasing number of conflicts and the various areas of tension arising from great-Power confrontation explain why ground has been lost in the international efforts aimed at disarmament."}
{"text": "That is why Uruguay considers that the most important factor for the attainment of real progress in this area would be the creation of an environment of greater confidence through systematic respect for international law, the foundation of coexistence among States."}
{"text": "183.\tIn particular, it is necessary that we abide strictly by the principles of non-intervention, self- determination and the peaceful settlement of disputes."}
{"text": "We wish to emphasize most strongly the need for strict observance of the principle of non-intervention."}
{"text": "In view of the present state of international relations, it is deplorable that intervention in the internal affairs of other States not only has assumed a variety of more or less sophisticated forms but also occurs with such frequency that it has become the hallmark of our times, to the detriment of those countries which are most vulnerable, with destabilizing consequences of serious proportions."}
{"text": "184.\tIt is more than ever necessary for us to heed the call for reflection and a responsible approach."}
{"text": "The gravity and intensity of the economic, social and political crisis affecting the vast majority of the peoples of the world has encouraged those who are stepping up their acts of intervention."}
{"text": "This generates unnecessary conflicts which enable them to disguise their own ineffectiveness or incompetence."}
{"text": "This situation has a particularly adverse impact on the economically weak countries."}
{"text": "Every country\u2014with rare exceptions\u2014knows that there are other countries that are more powerful, and this conditions what it does."}
{"text": "Thus, the revitalization of the principles of international law would allow everyone to take its proper place in a context of mutual respect."}
{"text": "185.\tWith each instance of direct or indirect violation of these principles, there is not only an attack on international law but also a threat to international peace and security."}
{"text": "186.\t"}
{"text": "It is necessary to strengthen the rule of law."}
{"text": "We should address ourselves to the biggest problems of our age."}
{"text": "I would mention here by way of example the adoption of a convention making it mandatory for all States to resolve disputes by peaceful means before such disputes become uncontrollable and the application of the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations therefore a mere illusion."}
{"text": "187.\t"}
{"text": "The powers of the International Court of Justice should be increased, making its intervention mandatory in certain cases."}
{"text": "188.\tUruguay, which was responsible for the earliest declaration under the terms of Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, appeals to all those States which are not yet doing so to do everything they can to ensure that the Court is given mandatory power in all disputes covered by that Article."}
{"text": "189.\tThe Security Council can undertake preventive action, which can lead to early solutions, particularly in the more critical cases."}
{"text": "Peace-keeping operations should be supported and strengthened."}
{"text": "190.\t"}
{"text": "The international community must increase its support for the Secretary-General and for the development of the duties that are implicit in his office, and in the provisions of the Charter."}
{"text": "191.\tFinally, the General Assembly should adopt precise decisions strengthening the role of the Organization in general and of the General Assembly in particular, taking into account the work in the relevant Committees and the views of Member States."}
{"text": "192.\t"}
{"text": "The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization, as in previous years, provides us with an objective assessment of steps that could be undertaken to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations."}
{"text": "193.\tThe great Powers, particularly the nuclear Powers, have a responsibility to make a substantial contribution to disarmament and peace."}
{"text": "Nevertheless, the magnitude of what is at stake\u2014the principles of international law, the legal structure of the Organization and, in the final analysis, the indivisibility of peace\u2014give each and every one of the Member States the right and the duty to act in this field."}
{"text": "194.\t"}
{"text": "It is fitting that we reaffirm, first, the validity of the objective of general and complete disarmament under international control."}
{"text": "However, this should not stand in the way of our trying to promote, wherever and whenever possible, all other efforts undertaken in this area."}
{"text": "In our view, the following collateral measures are called for: in the nuclear field, political support for halting and reversing the arms race; the initiation of negotiations between the superpowers; the extension of the ban on nuclear testing to cover underground tests; the creation and expansion of denuclearized zones and zones of peace; the negotiation of instruments guaranteeing the non-use of nuclear weapons against States which do not possess them; and the universalization of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons."}
{"text": "In the field of conventional weapons, we believe that agreements aimed at stopping the arms race and banning the production and use of especially destructive weapons, in particular chemical weapons, are also necessary."}
{"text": "195.\tThe political, institutional and legal measures necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security are closely linked to any process of disarmament, as well as with the indispensable confidence-building measures."}
{"text": "196.\t"}
{"text": "The international community can and must use its political influence and call with one voice for new efforts to ensure peace and progress through negotiations specifically aimed at disarmament in all forums."}
{"text": "197.\tThe Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament and was held in 1978, was fully endorsed in the Concluding Document of the Assembly's Twelfth Special Session, which was also devoted to disarmament, and continues to provide a firm basis for serious efforts in this area."}
{"text": "The comprehensive programme for disarmament, on which negotiations are now taking place, could become the necessary framework; it could mark the successful conclusion of the work undertaken and be a forerunner of the conclusion of that yet to be carried out steadily and without respite."}
{"text": "198.\tWhen considering the present situation throughout the world it is easy to grow disheartened, but that situation makes it imperative for the Organization to overcome the crisis."}
{"text": "For this there are precedents."}
{"text": "199.\tThe Charter of the United Nations enshrines a system of principles that constitute a new landmark in international law, allowing us to make significant strides in regulating important, areas of human endeavour."}
{"text": "The Organization has promoted vast decolonization enterprises and has formulated the most modern concepts of economic, social and political development."}
{"text": "The Organization, indeed, has become a forum for dialogue and discussion without precedent and with a unique universal character."}
{"text": "It has become the forum where all States, large and small, participate in the search for solutions and policies."}
{"text": "Increasingly, all opinions can be heard in an irreversible process of democratization."}
{"text": "200.\tOn the main issues of concern to the international community, the United Nations has made substantially correct decisions."}
{"text": "One must admit this, even if one disagrees in certain instances or is not satisfied with the implementation in others."}
{"text": "201.\t"}
{"text": "If we do not muster the necessary political will to find solutions through dialogue, if we cannot recover the sense of commitment to universal peace that created the Organization, we shall have nothing left but confrontation through which to solve our disputes."}
{"text": "This in turn will breed intolerance and radicalism in those who claim to possess the truth\u2014 their truth."}
{"text": "202.\tHere, among the Members of the United Nations, there is a binding political force that spurs negotiation forward, that demands peace and security that demands justice and fairness."}
{"text": "203.\tIt is a pleasure for me to express these thoughts on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations and at a moment of particularly historic importance for my country."}
{"text": "In the course of a long and trying political process, we Uruguayans have faced terrorist attacks with a sense of sacrifice and dignity, and, as we stated at the thirty-eighth session, we are now ready for the culmination of this stage with the holding of general elections next month that will be carried out on the basis of all the traditional guarantees of my country."}
{"text": "204.\tAllow me here to reaffirm Uruguay's support for the United Nations, support that has been unswerving from the time of the signing of the Charter to the present."}
{"text": "This attitude is not based on any transitory political interest or the position of any given administration."}
{"text": "It is a profound conviction held by my people, a people ready to contribute to peace with justice and under law, and thus to live in harmony with all the peoples of the world, in a united effort aimed at co-operation and development."}
{"text": "205.\tWe are still far from making a reality of the dreams and ideals of the founders, but time has confirmed the validity of those dreams and ideals."}
{"text": "I am honoured to address the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session as a representative of His Majesty the King of Swaziland."}
{"text": "I bring with me from the Kingdom of Swaziland warmest greetings and best wishes to all our fellow members from His Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the Government and the whole Swazi nation."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland congratulates you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session."}
{"text": "We are especially proud that a fellow southern African has been elected to this demanding position, and we are confident that your diplomatic skills and experience will help you guide and lead this Assembly towards the successful conclusion of its deliberations."}
{"text": "We should also like to commend the skilful leadership of the fifty-third session by your predecessor Mr. Didier Opertti."}
{"text": "We are meeting at a time of great challenges for the United Nations."}
{"text": "The membership is faced with a number of issues concerning the very shape of our Organization and the scope of operations that we choose to undertake."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that we are fortunate indeed to have at this time a Secretary-General who commands such universal respect and who possesses the qualities of determination, enthusiasm and leadership that are so necessary as we chart our course for the future."}
{"text": "We call on him and on the staff of the United Nations to keep up their good work in the service of all Member States."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the Secretary-General and his staff can best be supported by our continuing commitment to meeting our financial obligations in full and on time."}
{"text": "We call on all our fellow Members to comply by honouring their obligations so that our Organization can have sufficient resources with which to cope with the widening scope of its operations and to meet the expectations of us all."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland is delighted to extend a warm welcome to our Organization\u2019s three new Members: the nation States of Tonga, Nauru and Kiribati."}
{"text": "Their admission is further confirmation of our respect for the principles of universality and representation, as contained in the founding Charter of the United Nations."}
{"text": "But even as we welcome these new Members, the Kingdom of Swaziland is conscious that the principle of universality is not applied equally to others who feel excluded from the activities of our Organization."}
{"text": "I refer to the 22 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan, who believe that they are being denied their right\n\n\nto representation in the United Nations."}
{"text": "The Government and the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan have shown their willingness and capacity to contribute actively to global development and peace, through disaster relief and development support to many countries and regions."}
{"text": "The Republic of China on Taiwan is clearly a peace-loving nation, and is highly developed in all economic, social and political spheres."}
{"text": "It is the view of the Kingdom of Swaziland that international peace and security and equitable development for all mankind, can be achieved only through the inclusion of all the people of the world in the one truly global development Organization."}
{"text": "We therefore support the call from an increasing number of Member States for the establishment of a working group by the General Assembly to examine the exceptional international situation relating to the Republic of China on Taiwan and to ensure that the fundamental right of its 22 million people to participate in the work and activities of the United Nations is fully respected."}
{"text": "We recognize that, as has been the case in some other nations, the matter of reunification is for the Chinese people themselves."}
{"text": "The history of the twentieth century will have further evidence to support the belief that man apparently and surprisingly cannot live peacefully side by side with his neighbour, nor in harmony with nature and his environment."}
{"text": "Despite the many remarkable achievements of the last 99 years, notably in the collapse of ideological and political colonialism and in the fields of technology, science and medicine, it will be, in the end, by world wars, environmental degradation and the emergence of global epidemics that this century will be remembered."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the promotion of sustainable international peace and security must be the main priority for the United Nations, because it is clear that our collective aim of raising the living standards of our peoples is possible only in conditions of global stability and with nations living in harmony alongside one another."}
{"text": "It has long been recognized that the greatest threat to global peace lies in the continuing spread of weapons of mass destruction."}
{"text": "Our failure so far as an Organization to have true commitment from all Members to arms control and nuclear disarmament has meant that we enter the next millennium with this threat still overshadowing all matters of international relations."}
{"text": "The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty are designed as essential first steps towards a world free from the danger that such weapons pose."}
{"text": "We clearly need to find a way to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, and also to prevent the flow of conventional weapons and anti-personnel landmines into zones of conflict."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore calls upon the Conference on Disarmament to implement the proposal of the Non-Aligned Movement by establishing as its highest priority an ad hoc committee to begin negotiations on a programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, within a time-bound framework."}
{"text": "We also urge those States with nuclear weapons to implement faithfully both the letter and spirit of all agreements relating to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear disarmament."}
{"text": "Whilst the possibilities of global conflict have diminished since the end of the cold-war era, it is a fact that there has been a corresponding increase in the incidence of internal conflicts and cross-border disturbances arising from a variety of causes, including ethnic and religious confrontation."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the emphasis of the United Nations in dealing with this increase of internal and cross-border crises should be on the introduction of an effective mechanism of preventive diplomacy to stop incidents from escalating out of control."}
{"text": "This has been the focus of regional organizations of which the Kingdom of Swaziland is a member, such as the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)."}
{"text": "We believe that, while recognizing the overall responsibility of the United Nations towards global peace, the regional organizations must take the lead as the building blocks towards stability and closer cooperation."}
{"text": "The past year in international affairs has been a mix of progress in some areas of past conflict and the continuation or emergence of crises in many others."}
{"text": "The United Nations has quite correctly become involved in trying to help resolve each of these situations, to a greater or lesser degree, and the Kingdom of Swaziland commends its efforts and those of all who have played a similar role."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland recognizes the recent progress made by Israelis and Palestinians towards the 2\n\n\nimplementation of the Wye River peace accord."}
{"text": "This has been a most encouraging step towards lasting peace in the Middle East region and we applaud the courage and commitment of the leadership of both sides towards achieving this aim."}
{"text": "The crisis in the former Yugoslavia earlier this year gave us cause for great concern, especially in the light of the threat of the conflict\u2019s spreading to other Balkan States."}
{"text": "We pray that the recent return to relative stability will lead to lasting peace in that troubled region and that the wishes of the people for their future will be the guiding principle in any long-term dispensation."}
{"text": "We have viewed with concern the events in East Timor following the referendum on independence and we fully support the decision of the United Nations to accede to the request of the Indonesian Government for the urgent deployment of a peacekeeping force."}
{"text": "We appeal to all involved to restore calm to the situation and to respect the wishes of the people of East Timor for their future."}
{"text": "We have watched with equal concern the apparent setback in the peace process in Northern Ireland."}
{"text": "We support the efforts of the British and Irish Governments to create the right conditions of trust and confidence, in which the people of Northern Ireland can decide their future for themselves."}
{"text": "We urge all parties involved to exercise restraint and to rediscover the spirit of compromise and reconciliation that characterized the original Good Friday Agreement."}
{"text": "Closer to home, on our own continent of Africa, the past year has given cause for some optimism in a number of areas; but in others, the tale is all too depressingly familiar."}
{"text": "We welcome with great relief the signing of the Peace Agreement between the warring factions in Sierra Leone and we appeal to both sides to abide by the terms of the settlement so that their people may benefit from the dividend of peace after so many years of suffering and lack of development."}
{"text": "The continuing border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea has unsettled all in the Horn of Africa and we applaud the decision of both countries to agree to mediation efforts between them by the United Nations and the OAU."}
{"text": "We pray that this sensible move may lead to a peaceful settlement of the crisis."}
{"text": "The recent signing of an Agreement by all parties to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has encouraged all of us in the region."}
{"text": "We hope that there will be commitment by all signatories to the terms of the ceasefire and that a lasting solution may be found that will allow the Congolese people to develop their great potential in peace."}
{"text": "This last success is all the more encouraging for those of us in the SADC region, since it came about through the combined efforts of a number of SADC member States."}
{"text": "In a similar vein, heightened tension between two of our members, Angola and Zambia, was able to be defused before the situation could escalate into a crisis."}
{"text": "Both of these situations point to the acceptance of responsibility by our member States for resolving regional difficulties ourselves."}
{"text": "Of course, this does not preclude our welcome to the willingness of others, such as the OAU, the United Nations and individual countries that wish to be involved, especially in the provision of training and material and financial support."}
{"text": "But we firmly believe in the principle that African problems require african solutions and we are determined to come up with the means and mechanisms to abide by it."}
{"text": "On the negative side, the continent has seen the continuation of two crises that are having an especially damaging effect on the lives of the people involved and that we believe require the urgent attention of the United Nations."}
{"text": "The first concerns the deteriorating situation in Angola, where peace remains as elusive as ever."}
{"text": "We call on the leadership of UNITA to respect the terms of the Lusaka Protocol and to recognize the need to use it as the starting point in the search for lasting peace and national healing."}
{"text": "We appeal to the international community to continue to support the efforts of SADC and all of us who are involved in the quest for an end to the suffering of the Angolan people."}
{"text": "The situation is Somalia, while possessing different characteristics, has the same distressing effect on the people of that unfortunate country."}
{"text": "The fact is that the division and lack of any legitimate central authority in their country has deprived Somalis not only of peace and the chance for development, but also of a voice of appeal in regional and international forums."}
{"text": "The time has surely come for the United Nations to show real commitment to finding a solution to the Somalia crisis, in the same way that we are expending a 3\n\n\ngreat deal of effort and resources in crisis situations in other parts of the world."}
{"text": "The Somali people deserve the same concern and respect for their future from the rest of the world as those in countries with perhaps greater global recognition and resources."}
{"text": "The complex challenges facing the world today lend greater significance and urgency to the initiatives for reform of our Organization."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that these reforms are essential if the United Nations is to retain the global credibility and authority that are so necessary in its operations."}
{"text": "Recent history has shown clearly that the traditional mechanisms for harmonizing global relations and conflict resolution, in particular, are no longer effective, and the United Nations is in real danger of losing the confidence of its Members in these areas."}
{"text": "Our aim must be to transform our Organization into a structure that is truly representative of all our Members and that is transparent and efficient in its operations, while remaining consistent to the purposes and principles of our founding Charter."}
{"text": "We believe that the priority should be to achieve balanced representation in the principal organs of the United Nations."}
{"text": "The Security Council, as a particular example, requires reform in order to strengthen its legitimacy."}
{"text": "Its composition must reflect the plurality and diversity of the membership of the United Nations, with due regard for the profound geopolitical changes in recent history."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland reaffirms its full support for the African position on reform of the Security Council, namely, two permanent seats for Africa to be shared on a rotational basis, as well as three non-permanent seats, and a re-examination of the exercise of veto power."}
{"text": "It is a fact that the majority of Member States concur with this need for reform of the Security Council and that all agree on the urgency attached to the matter."}
{"text": "Yet there has been very little progress made so far by the Open-ended Working Group established to address this vital issue."}
{"text": "We are concerned at this lack of progress and would urge the Working Group to overcome whatever obstacles remain to a resolution that meets Members\u2019 demands for fairness and urgency."}
{"text": "Turning now to the question of the Millennium Assembly, to be convened next year, the Kingdom of Swaziland is encouraged by the emerging consensus among Member States on the need to articulate a vision for the international community in the year 2000."}
{"text": "We support the Secretary-General\u2019s theme of the United Nations in the twenty-first century and the proposed sub-topics for the Millennium Assembly."}
{"text": "Of these, we believe the closely related sub-topics of peace and security, on the one hand, and development and poverty eradication, on the other, to be of the highest priority in the context of the overall theme."}
{"text": "Future global stability depends on the ability of national Governments to increase the momentum for economic development and their capacity to improve the delivery of job creation and essential social services, such as health and education."}
{"text": "We believe that poverty eradication can be achieved only through the promotion of an accelerated pace of growth and development in the developing countries."}
{"text": "There can be no doubt that, to achieve this aim, we need the support of the rest of the international community, and this support can best be coordinated by the United Nations."}
{"text": "One key factor in the achievement of our aim of poverty eradication is the concept of the globalization and liberalization of the global economy."}
{"text": "The conclusion of the Uruguay Round, on the one hand, promised to open up enormous trade opportunities in the sale and movement of goods and services, but on the other it threatened the fragile economies of those countries that had not achieved the state of preparation to take full advantage."}
{"text": "The continent of Africa, in particular, continues to face a multitude of problems as we struggle to settle into the new world order."}
{"text": "Many of us are undertaking painful reforms of existing structures in order to respond to the demands of globalization and liberalization."}
{"text": "The implementation of structural adjustment programmes, often on the instructions of the Bretton Woods institutions, is having a severely adverse impact on the social welfare of many African countries, with devastating effects on the quality of life of our people."}
{"text": "We can see the result of these effects in many countries, where a decrease in expenditure on social programmes has led to heightened internal tension and instability."}
{"text": "Clearly, globalization and liberalization as concepts have much to recommend them."}
{"text": "Undoubtedly, they hold 4\n\n\nthe key to an economic future of equal opportunity for all countries."}
{"text": "But we are saying that they need to take into account the unequal starting points of each country: that some are better prepared than others to take full advantage of the opportunities they offer and that many of us may well lose any hope of catching up."}
{"text": "We are seeing the very sovereignty of countries being eroded by the power of multinational companies."}
{"text": "True economic power is being held in fewer and fewer hands, and the developing countries are becoming further marginalized."}
{"text": "Social problems increase as people lose jobs and capital and currency values are controlled elsewhere."}
{"text": "The developing countries cannot wish away globalization, but we would wish it to adopt a more human face, one that recognizes and makes allowances for the fundamental inequalities between the richer and the poorer nations of the world and makes concessions to allow us the opportunity to take full advantage of its opportunities in due course."}
{"text": "For our part in the Kingdom of Swaziland, we are aggressively pursuing political, economic, social and institutional reforms that will have a major impact on all aspects of national life, in accordance with the wishes and expectations of the Swazi people themselves."}
{"text": "This year, we launched the national development strategy, a people-driven vision for the long term, providing a planning framework for government action priorities for the next 25 years."}
{"text": "The core aim of the strategy is to achieve a sustainable increase in the standard of living of all Swazis, with particular emphasis on eliminating poverty from our society."}
{"text": "Our priority is to create the conditions for a vibrant economy and to increase our capacity to provide our people with a high level of human development."}
{"text": "This long-term blueprint has been used as the basis for two short- and medium-term programmes of action by the Government that are linked to timetables and are fully accountable for results."}
{"text": "The economic and social reform agenda is a performance management tool that identifies priority actions and keeps government performance under close, public scrutiny and the public sector management programme designed to improve service delivery and cost-effectiveness in the public sector."}
{"text": "We believe that these initiatives, with the wishes of the people at their heart, will provide us with the right conditions in which to prosper and to achieve our human development objectives."}
{"text": "We have very much appreciated the support of the United Nations in formulating the strategy."}
{"text": "The national development strategy should, from now on, form the priority target for all development support from United Nations agencies."}
{"text": "We would wish the same from the international development finance institutions."}
{"text": "We share the concern of many fellow Member States in the developing world that too often these institutions\u2019 target for support is not in tune with the wishes of the country involved and that the process of project design and approval is painfully slow."}
{"text": "We look forward to working with the United Nations Development Programme and the international finance institutions to design projects that coincide with the wishes of our own people, and within a time-frame that meets our expectations of speedy implementation."}
{"text": "In 1996, the Kingdom of Swaziland embarked on a review of its Constitution with the establishment of a commission that was tasked with collecting the views of all Swazis on all aspects of the present Constitution."}
{"text": "We have kept the General Assembly fully informed on the progress of this commission each year, and I am delighted to report that the people\u2019s recommendations on the Constitution will be presented to the nation at the end of this year."}
{"text": "The process will then move forward to the drafting of these recommendations into a formal document that will be confirmed by the people themselves, before final ratification."}
{"text": "Throughout the process of constitutional review, we have been guided by the principle of involving all Swazis in the drafting of what will be the Kingdom\u2019s defining document."}
{"text": "Consultation with our people on all important matters is a principle that we have followed throughout our history, and is one that has helped us to maintain the peace and stability with which we have always been blessed."}
{"text": "I have spoken at length about the efforts we in the Kingdom of Swaziland are making to improve the lives of our people."}
{"text": "And yet, all our plans and all our good intentions are meaningless in the face of the danger that threatens to overwhelm our nation."}
{"text": "I am referring, of course, to the HIV/AIDS crisis, which is already having a severe impact on the lives of many Swazi families and which undermines all our hopes for a future of prosperity and security for all our people."}
{"text": "We are facing up to the fact that the Kingdom of Swaziland has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the world, and our hospitals and clinics are stretched to the limit of capacity as a result."}
{"text": "We are making every effort to halt the spread of the 5\n\n\ndeadly disease."}
{"text": "But it is an uphill struggle and involves us in bringing about a wholesale change in attitude and moral behaviour."}
{"text": "Our chief concern is to promote awareness of the danger and of the preventive measures available."}
{"text": "Our resources are limited, and we need the continuing support of the international community in our efforts to reverse the downward trend."}
{"text": "This appeal was repeatedly made at the recent Eleventh International Conference on AIDS and STDs in Africa held in Lusaka."}
{"text": "We therefore join other Member States in a similar predicament in appealing to the United Nations to coordinate an international response to the crisis."}
{"text": "The very future of our nation, and that of many others, depends on those with the technical and financial resources joining forces with us to stem the deadly tide."}
{"text": "In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to express the deep gratitude of Their Majesties, the Government and the whole Swazi nation, to the United Nations Development Programme and all its sister agencies, for the many programmes of assistance undertaken in the Kingdom of Swaziland since our independence."}
{"text": "We believe that the United Nations, as the one truly global development Organization, remains the only hope for overcoming the many complex challenges facing the world today."}
{"text": "Despite the setbacks and obstacles to achieving our collective aims, there can be no doubt that the world would be a more troubled place without the combined efforts of all of us here."}
{"text": "The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore takes great pride in reaffirming its commitment to the principles and ideals contained in the United Nations Charter, and we ask Almighty God to watch over and guide us in the challenging times ahead for our Organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"text": "At the same time, the  protracted negotiating process for that resolution  reminded us once again of the importance of the ability  of the Council to respond, swiftly as well as  comprehensively, in such a crisis situation."}
{"text": "That is  never an easy task, but one we must always strive to  fulfil.   "}

{"text": "The ministerial conference on the  consolidation of peace, that was held under the  framework of the Tokyo International Conference on  African Development (TICAD) in February this year,  not only made an intellectual contribution to the  understanding of peace consolidation, but also  strengthened the will and solidarity of the African  States for peacebuilding."}

{"text": "Reform of the Organization\u2019s structure  and the manner in which it functions is, therefore,  critically important."}
{"text": "In September last year, leaders  expressed their resolve to achieve comprehensive  reform of this universal body."}
{"text": "One year on, some  encouraging progress has been made, including the  establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and  the Human Rights Council."}
{"text": "However, reform of the  Security Council remains outstanding on the  institutional reform agenda.   "}
{"text": "Perhaps a limited few may find it in their interest  to leave the Security Council configured in the way it  was in 1945."}
{"text": "It is clear, however, that no one stands to  gain from the waning credibility that failure to reform  could entail."}
{"text": "The call for a more effective,  representative and transparent Council that can meet  the demands of the new century is not mere rhetoric; it  is real and urgent."}
{"text": "An overwhelming majority of the  Member States, including Japan, agree that the  international community should approach and carry out  reform with a sense of urgency, and Japan is  determined to continue to take the initiative in this  critical endeavour."}
{"text": "The Member States now need a new  proposal on Security Council reform \u2014 one that is  both creative and persuasive \u2014 in order to take an  early decision during the current session of the General  Assembly."}

{"text": "Having made a significant contribution to the  activities of the United Nations since its inception,  Japan has an exemplary record with regard to the  fulfilment of its duties as a Member State, including  assessed contributions."}
{"text": "Nevertheless, we strongly  believe that the United Nations needs a reformed scale- of-assessments structure \u2014 one that is more equitable  and fair and duly takes into account the status and  responsibilities of each Member State."}
{"text": "Japan will work  together with other Member States to formulate such a  structure, which will bring financial stability to this  Organization.   "}
{"text": "Our common task for the sixty-first session is to  continue our work and translate the decisions on  reform made at the World Summit into reality."}
{"text": "Let us  join forces once again and create an efficient and  effective United Nations, so that Member States can  better respond to the aspirations and expectations of  the international community for a better future."}

{"text": "In some countries, a few short months of crisis was all it took to wipe out the gains of an entire generation."}
{"text": "Such crises shed light on an improper balance between the power of the market and the power of institutions."}
{"text": "Globalization and liberalization certainly have great merits."}
{"text": "They have forced the national political classes to set public finances in order and to promote economic efficiency."}
{"text": "But a global market requires some measure of global government built on the knowledge that the wealth of single States cannot be separated from the welfare of the international community, a government whose strength rests on the democracy of institutions."}
{"text": "As Secretary-General Kofi Annan underlined in his speech, globalization requires good government."}
{"text": "This is why we urgently need to strengthen international leadership."}
{"text": "The institutions are still not strong enough to provide such leadership, restore confidence, introduce change, stabilize the global economy, guarantee growth and protect the most vulnerable of us in the race towards development."}
{"text": "Technology, communications and the market are progressing at a much faster pace than politics and institutions, thus creating a widening gap."}
{"text": "In the final years of this century, our challenge is to strengthen institutions and their capacity to coordinate the action of Governments."}
{"text": "Globalization has impacts on ideologies and behaviour, societies and institutions."}
{"text": "The opening of markets to competition must be accompanied by reaffirmed cooperation among the largest possible number of States."}
{"text": "The burden of responsibility falls on the shoulders of the stronger nations, particularly those of the G-7."}
{"text": "They have a duty to show solidarity, transforming their privileges into benefits for all humanity."}
{"text": "The system of international institutions has the United Nations as its paramount and most authoritative benchmark."}
{"text": "The United Nations must be the driving force behind a review of the network of interdependence."}
{"text": "Like industrialization in its early days, globalization produces both great progress and dangerous imbalances."}
{"text": "Thus, it requires governance."}
{"text": "No one country can govern it, however great its political, economic and military power."}
{"text": "Our century is drawing to a close with a revitalization of institutions upon which we can build the three pillars of stability: prosperity, security and respect for fundamental freedoms."}
{"text": "The first pillar of stability is governance of the economy to prevent crises from degenerating into catastrophes."}
{"text": "The time has come to perfect the rules of conduct that guide the development of the global market."}
{"text": "19\n\n\nWhile these rules are imperfect and not always respected, we must assert the conviction that it is important and appropriate to observe them."}
{"text": "This is the secret of their success."}

{"text": "We nevertheless took part in the Conference of Plenipotentiaries because we are members of the Trade and Development Board, in whose work we place great hope, and because we were convinced that that Conference was the first of the many steps that must be taken to ensure that the development of the landlocked countries is not hampered by the unilateral will of the transit countries, which are not content to profit by the geographical position which has given them free access to the sea, but directly or indirectly impose prejudicial conditions on the transit trade of other sovereign States, which are thus subjected to difficulties and humiliations deriving from their land-locked position in addition to the evils of underdevelopment.\n\n118."}
{"text": "We repeat now what we said then: that just as it is no longer possible, in the sphere of human freedom, to imagine slaves in chains, so it is no longer possible, in the sphere of commercial freedom, to accept the idea of land-locked countries being restricted in their right to trade and limited in their ability to develop by the unilateral will of certain transit countries.\n\n\n119."}

{"text": "I must now refer to what Bolivia considers the crucial problem of our time, namely that of devising, under United Nations auspices, an international trade system \u2014 planned, 'world-wide and compulsory \u2014 which will give the emerging nations, especially those producing raw materials and primary commodities, a fairer and therefore much greater share of the profits from trade in those commodities."}

{"text": "This revolution rejects the arbitrary privileges and differences established by inertia and oppression and affirms that human beings \u2014 white or black, believers or atheists, poor or prosperous \u2014 are human beings first and foremost, that their rights in life and their duties to history are exactly equal and that the only differences that can and should be admitted in the hierarchy of values are the cultural differences deriving from the level of ethical, aesthetic and intellectual development attained by each individual.\n\n"}

{"text": "This is all a thing of the past, a settled account, and the peoples of the under-developed regions, far from wishing the big nations any harm, want to learn from their technology, to follow their example and to engage them in a friendly dialogue so that we may seek together a solution to the problem of the hungry man."}

{"text": "A few months ago I took part, as the representative of Bolivia, in the United Nations Tin Conference, convened pursuant to the Geneva recommendations to discuss a new international agreement designed to regulate the fluctuation of world market prices for that metal."}
{"text": "All the producing countries (which are under-developed countries), acting with exemplary unity and open sincerity and wielding convincing evidence based on facts, fought in vain to have included in the convention \u2014 I shall not say a higher price for tin, although the limited world production of 20,000 tons would entitle us to such a price \u2014 but simply a \"higher scale of prices\" which would enable the buffer stock to function effectively in relation to the real market price.\n\n\n123."}
{"text": "The developed countries participating in the Conference, i.e., the buyers, expressed deep sympathy for our problems but finally said \"no\"."}
{"text": "They ignored the non-recoverable nature of this wealth, the dreadful sacrifice and poverty of the miners, the rising price of the machinery needed in the mines, the need to stimulate long-term investment through remunerative prices and, what is most serious, they forgot the Geneva recommendations and all those great objectives, now nothing more than empty words, which once expressed our hopes."}
{"text": "They even told us that it would not be advisable to increase the price of tin because great progress was being made in the development of substitute materials, and so, answering our anguished demands with veiled threats, they left us where we were.\n\n124."}
{"text": "Countries with non-commercial tin stocks have continued to make sales which are totally unrelated to the free functioning of the market and are intended only to regulate prices directly, taking the buyers' interests into account but sacrificing the producers' expectations."}
{"text": "We may therefore conclude that as far as tin is concerned the ideals of Geneva and the influence of the United Nations are unable to raise the scale of prices to a realistic and remunerative level, to check the substitutes race which eventually may well deprive an entire nation of its income, or to persuade the powerful Governments of both East and West to refrain from disguised dumping, which helps powerful international industries but leaves the producing countries in their customary poverty.\n\n125."}
{"text": "We may learn some important lessons from this: the Trade and Development Board, and especially the Committee on Commodities, must aim at gradually transforming their theoretical documents into worldwide executive instruments compelling all States to agree on prices for raw materials which are fair in relation to development needs."}
{"text": "The Committee should devise objective and mandatory legal measures to eliminate the danger of substitutes as long as the commodities concerned are vital to the economy of any one country."}
{"text": "The Committee should also propose procedures designed to prevent anyone from altering the arrangements agreed upon in international commodity agreements through indiscriminate sales of non-commercial stocks."}

{"text": "The past 20 months of the fight against the pandemic have reminded us of a word that we, as Poles, learn in our cradles."}
{"text": "That word is \u201csolidarity\u201d."}
{"text": "Many of those present know what I am talking about."}
{"text": "The word refers in our history to a large independent trade union established in 1980 by industrial workers who went on strike against the communist regime and, in the 1980s and 1990s, inspired millions of people across the globe in their fight for their democratic and labour rights."}

{"text": "I salute those who won the vaccine battle in laboratories and those who, while risking their own health and lives, have vaccinated hundreds of millions of the cohabitants of our planet."}
{"text": "But has access to vaccines been fair?"}
{"text": "Have we not forgotten that, during a pandemic, a vaccine is more of a human right than a commodity regulated by market principles?"}
{"text": "I have wanted Poland to be, right from the start, a country of solidarity \u2014 a country not guided by the rule that the weaker has to die."}
{"text": "Therefore, we have tried to protect each and every life with the same commitment."}
{"text": "Therefore, whenever we could, we have tried to show solidarity with other nations that needed assistance at any given time."}

{"text": "I am convinced that some of the countries of the rich North have behaved in the same way as Poland, which has donated 6 million vaccine doses to, inter alia, our partners from the South."}
{"text": "Has that been enough, however, to close the obvious gap with regard to access to vaccines, which have been wasted in some States and inaccessible in others?"}
{"text": "It seems to me that, as part of this group, we should have many reasons to be dissatisfied with ourselves."}

{"text": "It is the right to self- determination and the right to democratic governance, set out in detail in the science of democratization and enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the United Nations."}
{"text": "I am absolutely sure that most of us agree on the fact that every one of our nations, the United Nations, has the right to protect its borders and their inviolability, choose its system of Government and govern with the consent of the nation, never against it."}

{"text": "I have the impression \u2014 and it is not only my impression \u2014 that COVID-19 has allowed us to easily forget about the multiple misfortunes plaguing different parts of our globe, often in the vicinity of our homes."}

{"text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved no closer to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which, as all of us know, requires a two-State solution and, above all, peaceful one."}

{"text": "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they paved the way for the realization that the right to form one\u2019s own Government is not a Western whim but a universal human right."}
{"text": "Belarusians want to ensure that their authorities respect that universal right."}
{"text": "They pay the price with their suffering and with imprisonment."}
{"text": "I say that as the leader of a country in which nearly 150,000 Belarusians have found shelter and employment, including thousands of protesters."}
{"text": "I recently told our Belarusian brothers that they are welcome in our country and that Poland will be their home for as long as they deem it to be appropriate and necessary."}
{"text": "I will honour those words."}
{"text": "Nonetheless, solidarity comes at a price because regimes defend themselves not only against their own citizens, but also against democratic States."}
{"text": "The response of the authoritarian regime in Belarus has taken the shape of an unprecedented hybrid attack on the borders of Poland, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 the three countries that make up the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union."}
{"text": "For several weeks, Alexandr Lukashenko\u2019s regime has brought tens of thousands of desperate inhabitants of the Middle East into the country, forcing them, with police batons, to cross our borders, in an attempt to create an artificial humanitarian crisis."}
{"text": "Those people then set up camp at the borders."}
{"text": "The regime ignores our offers to provide them with humanitarian aid."}
{"text": "It treats immigrants as pawns in a political game and undermines their dignity and fundamental rights."}
{"text": "We will not yield in that crisis, because we have not agreed to treating migrants as pawns."}
{"text": "We have not agreed to abuse their vulnerable plight, pitched against the security of our borders."}
{"text": "We protect those borders, as it is our duty to do so."}
{"text": "We are also a member of the European Union, which defends the borders of the European community."}
{"text": "I also say that as the leader of a country that knows very well how to tell the difference between a humanitarian crisis and hybrid activities."}
{"text": "Together with its allies, our country participated in the refugee rescue operation at Kabul airport, just a few weeks ago."}
{"text": "Initially, our intention was to evacuate dozens of military and diplomatic staff who cooperated with us."}
{"text": "We ended up evacuating more than 1,300 people."}
{"text": "We helped other countries to evacuate their own people."}
{"text": "We also benefited from the solidarity of others, in particular the Republic of Uzbekistan, and we are deeply grateful for that."}
{"text": "I remind members once again that the world did not come to a standstill during the pandemic."}
{"text": "The pandemic has not deprived nations of their democratic aspirations; neither has it stifled people\u2019s desire to live in freedom."}
{"text": "It has not suppressed the craving for dignity and respect across large swathes of the globe."}
{"text": "I recently saw for myself the enthusiasm among Moldovan voters, who took power away from the oligarchs plundering the country and voted in favour of reforms, democracy, normalcy and honesty."}
{"text": "I assured them of Poland\u2019s support for any initiative of the kind in our region, wherever we have influence."}
{"text": "These are the times that restore faith in the most fundamental values of humankind and inspire the spirit of profound solidarity in other countries, including my own country."}
{"text": "As trivial as it may sound, we all realize that humankind is not homogeneous and each of us has his or her own values and beliefs that are sacrosanct to us."}
{"text": "However, the experience of sharing the same planet and the knowledge that we have no other teach coexistence and prompt us to define its framework."}
{"text": "International law is that framework."}
{"text": "It is one of the greatest achievements of modern times."}
{"text": "We can debate at length about reform of the United Nations system, but each debate comes down to one fundamental element \u2014 how to promote the role of the United Nations in securing the primacy of international law, because we want to live in a world based on law, not on force."}
{"text": "Securing respect for international law was one of Poland\u2019s priorities as a member of the Security Council in 2018 and 2019."}
{"text": "Today we continue in the same vein, in support of international law, by serving on the Human Rights Council."}
{"text": "Our priority is to protect vulnerable groups, civilians in armed conflict and religious minorities."}
{"text": "The same purpose will be pursued by the Polish chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2022, where we will work to resolve regional and frozen conflicts."}
{"text": "We want to tap OSCE potential to improve the conditions of the weakest and most vulnerable people."}
{"text": "We will also strive to make human rights the main point of reference for OSCE activities, on the premise that solidarity is the fundamental value underlying human rights \u2014 the rights enjoyed by every human being."}
{"text": "The pandemic has nearly removed from the headlines another major topic \u2014 the fight against climate change and for a secure future for us all, our children and grandchildren."}
{"text": "We leaders must realize what it takes to protect people and the planet from climate change."}
{"text": "The problem will not disappear with the pandemic."}
{"text": "It is also part of international solidarity."}
{"text": "Let me pose this question once again \u2014 do we, the rich North, pass the test of solidarity, or do we merely cater to our own statistics by relocating production to the poorer countries of the South, where the least environmentally friendly technologies are employed?"}
{"text": "Those countries are then blamed for polluting the planet."}
{"text": "I say this as the leader of a country that overthrew the communist dictatorship in 1989 and inherited a very difficult ecological situation in the aftermath."}
{"text": "Over the past 30 years, we have made tremendous progress on that front."}
{"text": "Between 1988 and 2016, Poland reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 30 per cent."}
{"text": "Our rivers and air are cleaner, and the country is much greener."}
{"text": "Moreover, we have more forests."}
{"text": "As a country with primeval forests, woods, great lakes and rivers, Poland attracts nature lovers from all over Europe every year."}
{"text": "I could also add that the percentage of hard coal in our energy mix is systematically decreasing, with biofuels and renewable energy sources gaining ground."}
{"text": "At this point, let me humbly admit that that is only the beginning of the road."}
{"text": "We have a long road ahead of us."}
{"text": "Nonetheless, I believe we will manage, as we are very ambitious in that regard and we understand the challenges of the future."}
{"text": "Indeed, during our presidency of the twenty- fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we managed to finalize the negotiations on the Katowice Rulebook \u2014 an agreement that streamlines the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change so as to make it transparent and fair to all parties."}
{"text": "It is also fair to say that we supported the transformation of our energy sector, with due respect to the socioeconomic context."}
{"text": "However, at the same time, we realize that more effort will be needed."}
{"text": "Therefore, in February this year, the Polish Government stamped its seal of approval on the Energy Policy of Poland Until 2040, which maps out the direction of energy transformation."}
{"text": "The document is an important step towards the transition to low- and zero-emissions in the Polish economy."}
{"text": "It is my firm belief that, in the name of solidarity, the strategy will continue to be implemented by the Government of my successor to office."}
{"text": "I believe that the fundamental principle \u2014 that of a just transition \u2014 will be maintained."}
{"text": "The transition should take into account social needs, possibilities and the importance of people living in dignity and, being employed and able to raise their children."}
{"text": "That also takes into account the interests of the family."}
{"text": "Solidarity has not ceased to exist in the face of a pandemic."}
{"text": "It should remain our motto."}
{"text": "Our central tenet, in addition to others, should be to ensure that we do not compromise on human rights and the rights of entire nations so as to guarantee the development of the United Nations, always with respect for the primacy of international law."}
{"text": "We should always be ready to set and pursue ambitious goals in the fight for our planet."}
{"text": "Over the past 20 months, as the pandemic has weighed heavily on us, we have often asked ourselves, what will the post-pandemic world be like?"}
{"text": "Will it be a world where solidarity reigns?"}
{"text": "Or will we return to business as usual and consider those months as nothing more than an interruption in our routine, after which we can continue repeating past mistakes?"}
{"text": "Personally, I believe that mankind shares the same aspirations: security and prosperity, democracy and human rights."}
{"text": "We share aspirations of a world without wars and border violations; of nations respecting each other\u2019s territories, languages and identities; of a world without discrimination or any undermining of the inherent dignity of human beings; a world that consistently endorses, among others, the principles invoked by the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; a world based on solidarity among people and among States."}
{"text": "I believe that Poland will continue striving for that world, no matter who holds the office of its President."}
{"text": "Whether man or woman, I believe our next leader will continue striving to build that world."}
{"text": "\ufeff I take great pleasure in seeing you, Sir, a distinguished representative of the Republic of Malta presiding over this session of the General Assembly."}
{"text": "Finland has been in close co-operation with Malta both in Europe and in the United Nations."}
{"text": "We know that our countries share fundamental convictions about world order and world organisation."}
{"text": "I wish you every success in your responsible task."}
{"text": "I wish to take this opportunity also to thank your predecessor."}
{"text": "His Excellency Mr. Joseph Garba of Nigeria, for the outstanding services he rendered to the General Assembly during the last session."}
{"text": "In Europe the year 1989 will be remembered as a year of momentous change and a breakthrough of popular will."}
{"text": "The year 1990 has been a year of consolidation and of elections confirming the course of change."}
{"text": "We welcome these developments."}
{"text": "We welcome in particular the spirit of freedom and democracy that has animated peaceful change both in Europe and elsewhere."}
{"text": "It is all the more tragic that mankind in 1990 has had to witness a singularly blatant act of aggression by Iraq against Kuwait."}
{"text": "Therefore the year 1990 has for the United Nations become a year of collective action is the face of aggression."}
{"text": "The international community has shown solidarity and determination in allying the sanctions mandated by the Security Council because of the occupation of Kuwait."}
{"text": "The response by the United Nations represents great progress in the ability of the world Organization to live up to its ideals and act in defence of the freedom, sovereignty and integrity of one of its Member States."}
{"text": "Finland is strongly of the view that political problems everywhere must be solved peacefully and that social and political change also must come about peacefully."}
{"text": "This principle applies to the Middle East, to the Persian Gulf and to other crisis areas just as well as to Europe.  "}
{"text": "Europe is heading towards a new existence, without confrontation and without the cold war."}
{"text": "We are not yet sure what the new Europe will be like in all its details; but we trust that it will offer all its inhabitants opportunities to live in dignity and freedom without discrimination and without fear."}
{"text": "What is sure and, indeed, gratifying is that Germany will be unified the day after tomorrow."}
{"text": "German unification will be an essential building block in the new undivided Europe within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE;, \u03bb milestone in this process will be the summit of the CSCE countries to be held in Paris in November."}
{"text": "Much remains to be done in order to meet the aspirations of the peoples of Europe."}
{"text": "At the same time, the new Europe cannot be oblivious of the needs of the rest of the world."}
{"text": "On the contrary, Europe needs all the other continents, and Europe must be open to all of them."}
{"text": "The building of a new structure of peace in Europe is under way, but the underlying ideas and principles are already in place."}
{"text": "In fact they are in evidence right here in this Organization, for they are universal."}
{"text": "The new process in Europe flows directly from the principles of national self-determination, political freedom and social justice."}
{"text": "We believe that there are important lessons to be drawn from the recent events in Europe."}
{"text": "First of all, it has become clear that the ideas of freedom, democracy and human rights are so powerful that sooner or later they will reassert themselves."}
{"text": "This does not mean that mankind is thereby brought to the end of history, as some have claimed."}
{"text": "There are important and difficult challenges to face both in individual countries and in co-operation on a global scale."}
{"text": "Secondly, the abandonment of the totalitarian regimes in a number of European and other countries also helps enhance international confidence and security."}
{"text": "The easing of the military confrontation is well under way in Europe."}
{"text": "In the long run, this should make it possible to devote growing resources to other pressing needs instead of armaments.  "}
{"text": "Thirdly, an emerging awareness of global priorities seems to have been prominent in the dynamic movement for change."}
{"text": "This is important for the new directions that must be given to international co-operation in the nineties and beyond."}
{"text": "This new awareness is strongly felt in Europe, but it is in fact global, present in all parts of the world."}
{"text": "This very awareness moved the General Assembly five months ago to agree unanimously on the Declaration of International Economic Co-operation."}
{"text": "It is one of the forces driving the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to take place in Brazil in 1992."}
{"text": "The ides of sustainable development should now direct the preparatory work for that Conference as well as the preparations for the new international development strategy which will be formulated by the General Assembly during the present session.  "}
{"text": "The problems that will be on the agenda of the 1992 Conference require urgent action by Governments."}
{"text": "They require action now and they require long-term policies."}
{"text": "I am thinking, for example, of policies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other substances that have a direct impact on the climate of the Earth as a whole."}
{"text": "For decades Governments have rallied to the idea of development, and development has been interpreted largely as the combination of growth and change - sometimes maybe only as growth of the gross national product."}
{"text": "Today, we know that a more comprehensive concept is needed."}
{"text": "We welcome the combined emphasis on environmental protection and development in the preparations for the 1992 Conference, for in the long run, one is not possible without the other."}
{"text": "We welcome, too, the emphasis on human development, which should lead to freedom from disease, ignorance and political repression."}
{"text": "However, it is more and more difficult to envisage how the resources of the Earth can sustain a steadily growing world population."}
{"text": "Human development and dignity cannot be achieved with the present rates of population growth."}
{"text": "All individuals should be able to enjoy equally the benefits of development, human rights and peace."}
{"text": "In this general debate it is not enough to speak only about general trends and global challenges."}
{"text": "Some specific issues and problems must also be addressed."}
{"text": "Let me first express my country's satisfaction at the continuing trend towards universality of membership in the United Nations."}
{"text": "Less than two weeks ago, we welcomed the most recent Member State, the Principality of Liechtenstein, a country with which Finland has closely collaborated in the process of advancing security and co-operation in Europe.  "}
{"text": "This year, we have also welcomed the Republic of Namibia as a Member of the United Nations."}
{"text": "Namibia's independence - after a long process culminating in free and fair elections - bears witness to the ability of the United Nations to promote peaceful change."}
{"text": "Namibia's Constitution based on pluralism could serve as a model for other countries in Africa and elsewhere."}
{"text": "More attention will now be focused on South Africa where far-reaching political Change is called for."}
{"text": "We recognise the real change that has already taken place in South Africa."}
{"text": "The measures taken to remove some parts of the apartheid system are steps in the right direction, and we welcome them."}
{"text": "We are encouraged by the assertions of the South African Government that the process of change is irreversible."}
{"text": "Guided by their commitment to a peaceful process of negotiation, the Government of South Africa and representatives of the majority population should now lay the basis for giving all South Africans, regardless of the colour of their skin, a common responsibility, a common stake in the future of their country."}
{"text": "As avenues to peaceful change are being opened, there is a concomitant need for all to renounce violence as a means of dealing with South Africa's pressing problems."}
{"text": "The dialogue should help to build confidence and overcome fear."}
{"text": "Progress will require mutual moderation as well as mutual understanding."}
{"text": "Finland keeps the situation in South Africa under close and constant review."}
{"text": "We do not regard it as opportune to lift the sanctions that Finland imposed on South Africa some years ago in accordance with the Nordic programme of action against apartheid, since apartheid is still there."}
{"text": "In recognition of the change that has occurred we have, however, modified the guidelines concerning the issuance of visas to South African citizens."}
{"text": "Thus, we want to facilitate contacts that may contribute to further dialogue in South Africa."}
{"text": "If the reforms in South Africa continue as we hope they will, we shall review our Finnish policies towards South Africa accordingly."}
{"text": "There is one region in the world which is not yet a part of the trend towards peaceful political change - the region of the Middle East."}
{"text": "Every State Member of the United Nations is now affected by the aggression against Kuwait and its occupation which has continued since the beginning of August."}
{"text": "Every Member State is engaged in our common efforts to dislodge the aggressor and achieve a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the occupied country."}
{"text": "One cannot but be concerned at the fate of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, of both Kuwaiti and other nationalities, many of them fleeing in a state of destitution and panic, as well as at the shocking news that is seeping out from occupied Kuwait itself."}
{"text": "All of this shows that international efforts to end the occupation are not enough."}
{"text": "Solidarity and generosity are required of all of us, both to help the suffering people and to re-establish order and well-being."}
{"text": "Finland's own experience tells us that we must work, above all, for the strengthening of the principles of international law which protect the interests of all nations, in particular those of the small ones."}
{"text": "Respect for these principles is essential for our own existence and independence."}
{"text": "The independence and integrity of Kuwait are matters of vital importance to Finland."}
{"text": "If necessary, the United Nations should not shrink from taking further steps to overcome aggression and uphold the principle of collective security."}
{"text": "The search for international peace and security has also prompted Finland to serve the United Nations elsewhere in the Middle East where the need for peace, stability and the end of occupation is no less urgent."}
{"text": "The tension in the region is also continuously experienced by almost 1,000 Finnish soldiers, on duty as peace-keepers for the United Nations."}
{"text": "Here the world has already waited too long for decisive steps to be taken from peace-keeping to peace-making."}
{"text": "It is clear to us that Israel and the Palestinians must live peacefully as neighbours with full respect for the rights of each other, including, of course, the right of Israel to exist within secure and recognised borders, as well as the right of the Palestinians to national self-determination."}
{"text": "The well-known resolutions of the Security Council must be implemented."}
{"text": "The road to progress may include elections, negotiations and an international conference of all interested parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization."}
{"text": "The present policies of Israel in the occupied territories have exacerbated the situation instead of laying the basis for progress towards a comprehensive political settlement."}
{"text": "This Organization was created in order to help nations change themselves and the world peacefully."}
{"text": "That is still the aim of the United Nations."}
{"text": "That is the kind of change I have spoken about and welcomed today."}
{"text": "At the same time, we are committed by the Charter not to tolerate change imposed by violence."}
{"text": "These are the two challenges now facing the United Nations."}
{"text": "Let us meet them together."}
{"text": "As we approach the second anniversary of the beginning of the worst catastrophe in almost a century, humankind has not yet been able to bring this terrible chapter of the coronavirus disease pandemic to an end."}
{"text": "Nevertheless, we come to this forum with the hope of renewing and strengthening the bonds of cooperation and solidarity as fraternal nations."}
{"text": "This community of States faces enormous challenges that can be effectively addressed only through renewed multilateralism."}
{"text": "Indeed, in the face of pandemics, the climate emergency, the technological revolution and the need to articulate a new paradigm for the welfare state, it is vital to strengthen unity and cooperation among all nations."}
{"text": "We have a historic responsibility to leave the world a better place than when we found it, but that is possible only if we take seriously the global transition towards a new ecological, sustainable, inclusive and equitable production model, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."}
{"text": "That change is possible only through a global and multilateral effort that guarantees the rule of law, human rights and the well-being of all peoples, leaving no one behind."}
{"text": "Despite the unfortunate scenario created by the pandemic, our Government has promoted a free vaccination plan, the success of which can be seen in tangible results and telling statistics: 57 per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, approximately 70 per cent has received at least one dose and more than 10 per cent has received a third dose, with a case fatality rate of 1.14 per cent \u2014 one of the lowest in the world."}
{"text": "In line with our vision of shared responsibility to find a way out of the pandemic and because we have an inventory of vaccines that has allowed us to do so, we have donated, in a spirit of solidarity, some 820,000 doses to other countries in our region, as we are convinced that we will be safe only once we are all vaccinated."}
{"text": "However, although we have begun to emerge from the pandemic, that will not be enough to overcome the current economic and financial crisis."}
{"text": "In the interest of maintaining social peace, we are called upon to find a solution to the enormous debt that middle-income countries have been forced to incur in order to cope with the economic and social havoc wrought by the pandemic."}
{"text": "There is currently no mechanism for accessing concessional finance that would allow us to solve the liquidity crisis."}
{"text": "To address that challenge, we are forced to seek innovative yet also urgent solutions."}
{"text": "Recently, the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund provided an allocation equivalent to $650 billion in special drawing rights, with the objective of strengthening global liquidity."}
{"text": "States members of the International Monetary Fund received those funds according to their country quotas."}
{"text": "That meant that a large proportion of those resources went to developed countries \u2014 precisely those that need them the least."}
{"text": "In order to resolve that unjust situation, industrialized countries should devote those resources to the creation of a mechanism to channel the quotas they received to low- and middle-income countries, giving them access to concessional funds."}
{"text": "Multilateral financial institutions would play a key role in such a mechanism, ensuring that those resources reach the countries that truly need them."}
{"text": "That initiative would have a very positive impact on international financial markets, as it would make debt more sustainable and strengthen confidence in our economies while also improving the cost of financing."}
{"text": "The Government over which I have the honour to preside is firmly convinced that democracy is the political system that best guarantees the dignity, well-being and happiness of the people and that it can be sustained only if it is deepened and broadened."}
{"text": "For that reason, I am proud that we have called all sectors of national life in our country to an open and pluralistic dialogue to achieve reforms that contribute to strengthening the social and democratic rule of law in the Dominican Republic."}
{"text": "In that connection, the Dominican Republic is a firm defender of democracy and human rights, which implies strengthening checks and balances of the executive branch, such as an independent judiciary, the decisions of which are widely respected by all."}
{"text": "Our Government is committed to ensuring the independence of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and other oversight bodies, as well as the reform of the national police, in order to guarantee the rule of law and citizen security."}
{"text": "In the same vein, our fundamental purpose is to defend the public sector: the common heritage of Dominicans."}
{"text": "That requires fully transparent management, which is one of the achievements that gives us the greatest satisfaction."}
{"text": "In the midst of the current difficult circumstances, our citizens continue to demand that we act courageously against corruption, and we have been demonstrating our conviction in that regard with clear, precise and forceful actions."}
{"text": "Regarding the economy, I am pleased to note that even in the midst of such difficulties, our country has reason to be optimistic."}
{"text": "We are forecasted to end the year 2021 with an economic growth rate of 10 per cent and to maintain a growth rate of more than 5 per cent in the years to come."}
{"text": "I would like to suggest three actions that we consider urgent and necessary for our region and our country."}
{"text": "First, the Dominican Republic, as a small island developing State, is one of the countries that produces the least greenhouse- gas emissions but suffers the most from the effects of climate change."}
{"text": "Now is the time to promote a global transformation of the economy that aligns with development levels and ensures that the required standards do not impose excessive burdens leading to additional costs that harm competitiveness and the production of goods and services."}
{"text": "It is also just and necessary that the enormous investments required to restore our natural resources affected by global warming should be paid for by the countries that have generated the most carbon dioxide."}
{"text": "The second action concerns the fact that the current financial crisis and increased levels of indebtedness caused by the pandemic cannot be resolved solely by increasing taxes in our respective countries, given the attendant social pressures and potential for upheaval."}
{"text": "We must be creative, and we are convinced that, at no cost to their Governments, the multilateral and bilateral financial institutions can provide credit facilities through transparent, accessible, concerted and non-discriminatory mechanisms that will help countries in difficulty to quickly regain financial sustainability and access to international financial markets, with preferential rates that are not affected by the country risk index."}
{"text": "Our third and last recommended action concerns Haiti."}
{"text": "Since we took office, we have warned repeatedly that the situation in Haiti could potentially spill over its borders and lead to insecurity in the region."}
{"text": "That is why this community of nations must urgently, once and for all, attend to the Haitian crisis as one of its highest priorities, requiring ongoing follow-up."}
{"text": "We have taken note of the fact that some Governments have recently adopted measures to deal with the consequences of the Haitian crisis."}
{"text": "For years, our country has had to face the consequences of that tragic situation every day virtually alone."}
{"text": "We are convinced that no unilateral action will be sufficient to overcome it."}
{"text": "It is imperative that we state in the strongest and most emphatic terms possible that the international community must not and cannot abandon the Haitian people when the current levels of insecurity are leading to their self-destruction."}
{"text": "I want to say this today as sincerely as possible without the niceties of diplomatic language."}
{"text": "Given the current division within the Haitian leadership and the dangerous presence of criminal gangs that control a significant part of their territory, the Haitians people will not by themselves be able to bring peace to their country, much less guarantee the necessary conditions for establishing a minimum level of order."}
{"text": "Consequently, the most important and urgent issue is bringing about security in Haiti."}
{"text": "Only after that has been achieved can free, fair and credible elections be held."}
{"text": "Subsequently, with a new Government as a legitimate interlocutor, a truly comprehensive economic and social development plan will have to be prepared, with all required resources and the support and solidarity of the international community, for it is no longer possible to think only about humanitarian measures."}
{"text": "At this solemn gathering, I would like to state that the Dominican Republic has shown and will continue to show the solidarity and collaboration that the Haitian people deserve, but I also reiterate that there is not now and never will be a Dominican solution to the Haiti crisis."}
{"text": "The number of challenges facing our States is significant with regard to building a world under the banner of equality."}
{"text": "However, we must not face them alone."}
{"text": "Unity and multilateralism are the best ways to advance towards the goal without leaving anyone behind."}
{"text": "I firmly believe that with every passing day, the leadership of the United Nations will continue to be revitalized and strengthened."}
{"text": "The Dominican State reaffirms its commitment to the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations \u2014 peace, human dignity, justice, social progress and freedom."}
{"text": "Let us move firmly towards a renewed and more equitable welfare state."}
{"text": "We cannot fail our peoples."}
{"text": "We cannot fail history."}

{"text": "Mr. President, I am pleased to be one of the first speakers to congratulate you on your election, which my delegation regards as a tribute both to your personal qualities and to the important role your country has played in the United Nations."}

{"text": "The sad truth is that every serious issue I and many others raised last year remain unresolved and some now pose a greater threat to peace and security than they did 12 months ago."}
{"text": "It has not been a good year for the United Nations."}
{"text": "46.\tSmall wonder that our deliberations have so little relevance for our publics back home or for the many millions around the world whom we are committed to help but who have become disillusioned and cynical about our ability to fill answers to what are in many cases, matters of life and death."}
{"text": "47.\tI make these judgments with regret."}
{"text": "No country has been more consistent than Canada in supporting the principles of the United Nations."}
{"text": "We do not have to apologize for our record here or for the attitude of the Canadian people in accepting responsibilities for peacekeeping, for leadership in the North-South dialogue and for making a fair contribution to all United Nations initiatives."}
{"text": "Canada and Canadians have earned the right to be heard and what Canadians are saying is that the performance of the United Nations is not good enough."}
{"text": "48.\tCanada does not, of course, exclude itself from all blame for this inadequate record."}
{"text": "Like other countries, there are times when we get our priorities mixed and lack the proper sense of urgency in dealing with new or continuing threats to world order and security."}
{"text": "Nor am I interested merely in pointing the finger at others for the dubious pleasure of giving vent to my own frustrations."}
{"text": "I speak as I do because I know that many of you share my views."}
{"text": "It is not our sense of commitment that is flagging; no one in his right mind would wilfully project the world towards more bloodshed and potential global conflict."}
{"text": "All of us want peace and order in international affairs."}
{"text": "49.\tYet we are trapped in the tangled thickets of history, of fear, suspicion, and ancient deep-seated antagonisms."}
{"text": "Self-interest usually prevails over our efforts to define and foster larger, more generous objectives."}
{"text": "I am aware of the conviction of many in this Organization and elsewhere that this is the reality of international affairs- the real world  as they call it\u2014that glaring imperfections are a normal and unavoidable part of the human condition and that we must resign ourselves to the mere containment of the most virulent and dangerous manifestations of human greed and irrationality, accepting that the world's fate is to stumble on from one crisis to the next."}
{"text": "There are grounds for healthy scepticism, I agree; but in the United Nations that scepticism gives way too often to resignation and to a form of professional cynicism that views all new approaches as yet another example of short-lived idealistic naivet\u00e9."}
{"text": "50.\tLet me assure you that I am not naive; but I cannot accept, Canada cannot accept, that this Organization and its Member States are powerless to remove the root-causes of those major tensions that now require all of us to live out our lives in the constant shadow of impending disaster."}
{"text": "51.\tThere is among us another widely held view that, while any country can light a fire, only the super-Powers have the option of either fuelling its flames or putting it out."}
{"text": "There is, of course, a key role for the large, wealthy and powerful nations and their actions should not be greeted by automatic mistrust."}
{"text": "But for smaller countries to do nothing or adhere blindly and unquestioningly to this or that power bloc is to avoid responsibility and to make a mockery of the United Nations and the opportunity it provides for reasoned, free and open debate."}
{"text": "52.\tHowever awesome the outcome of super-Power decision-making and action can be, we must never forget that many of today's flash-points are not of their making."}
{"text": "Many smaller countries have shown that they are perfectly capable entirely on their own of causing problems for all of us."}
{"text": "And such actions are all the more reprehensible when they risk or even invite the escalation of East-West tensions."}
{"text": "53.\tIf we are to make progress here, there must be an end to the sterile debates of recent years where the outcome is always a foregone conclusion."}
{"text": "If the vitality of open debate is not restored to the United Nations then increasingly the important decisions affecting the fate of mankind will be made elsewhere and this Organization and most of its agencies will wither into insignificance and, eventually, unlamented oblivion."}
{"text": "54.\t"}
{"text": "Lest any consider this too harsh a judgment and too pessimistic a forecast, I ask you to recall objectively the reaction of many of our own publics to United Nations deliberations and resolutions."}
{"text": "My own experience at home and around the world has been bad."}
{"text": "55.\tGranted these criticisms are often based on prejudice or ignorance."}
{"text": "But we know too that much can and should be done to make the United Nations more effective."}
{"text": "I propose to give certain examples as well as suggestions for improvement."}
{"text": "56.\tTwo of the main issues that will come before us at this session are the Middle East and southern African situations."}
{"text": "Last year we adopted 20 resolutions on the Middle East and no less than 34 on questions related to southern Africa."}
{"text": "To what purpose was all that time and effort, not to mention money, expended?"}
{"text": "The answer is surely  very little  because many of those resolutions simply expressed moral judgments and were devoid of practical proposals for action."}
{"text": "Furthermore, everyone knew that they had little if any prospect of being implemented."}
{"text": "Yet the vast and increasingly expensive machinery of the United Nations ground on not only through the 50-odd resolutions I have mentioned but through nearly 200 more, many in the same category and thus predestined to suffer the same fate."}
{"text": "Already gathering dust, I suspect, is the 400-page compendium of those resolutions, most echoing word for word the deliberations of previous years."}
{"text": "57.\t"}
{"text": "No one should be surprised therefore at the indifference with which the media and the public greet their publication."}
{"text": "By adopting more resolutions we have succeeded paradoxically in ensuring that they receive less, not more, attention."}
{"text": "Changing our collective habits will not be easy."}
{"text": "By passing more resolutions we are certainly letting our situation deteriorate."}
{"text": "We should scrutinize the agenda closely to resist the automatic re-inclusion of old items and the addition of less essential new ones."}
{"text": "We should group items so that similar debates will not take place in different committees on closely related subjects."}
{"text": "We should avoid the proliferation of resolutions which express the Members' aspirations or objectives but do not contribute in a practical way to achieving any of them."}
{"text": "A few short, precise and practical resolutions will have more impact than the many rambling and ineffective ones we now consider each year."}
{"text": "58.\t"}
{"text": "As a member once each decade of the Security Council, Canada has accumulated some experience but also has a chance to take a fresh look at its activities every time we return."}
{"text": "So far this year, the Council has debated several significant issues in a sensible, restrained fashion."}
{"text": "None of us would claim, however, that it has done much to enhance its position as the United Nations organ with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security."}
{"text": "Our Secretary-General has wisely warned us of the risk that there may come, in his words,  a time when the Council is desperately needed and will be found to be too weak to fulfil its responsibilities."}
{"text": "59.\tThe problems arise, not because of weaknesses in the Council's structure or powers but, rather, from a lack of impetus."}
{"text": "To give a greater sense of purpose to the Council, the Charter provides for periodic meetings at which members be represented by a Cabinet member or other specially designated representative."}
{"text": "Remarkably, Mr. President, as you well know, the Council held the first of such meetings in its history at the time of the twenty-fifth anniversary celebrations."}
{"text": "This Assembly welcomed the Council's intention to hold further periodic meetings, but none has taken place."}
{"text": "60.\tI propose that the Security Council should begin meeting regularly at ministerial level."}
{"text": "Fifteen ministers meeting together could give a new sense of life and political purpose to the Council."}
{"text": "Instead of following a formal agenda, they could have a free discussion of major issues of international peace and security, based on, perhaps, a special report by the Secretary-General."}
{"text": "The meetings should be held in an informal atmosphere, without a small army of advisers, thus allowing the ministers to exchange views informally."}
{"text": "Meetings at ministerial level should be held once or twice a year rather than once every 25 years."}
{"text": "The first meeting might well be devoted to finding ways to make the work of the Council more relevant to the major issues of peace and security."}
{"text": "61.\tWhen I spoke here last year, I suggested that the Economic and Social Council should be given a more significant role."}
{"text": "At its spring and summer sessions, the Council considers a bewildering variety of issues."}
{"text": "It has even less success in what should be its central task-setting priorities and  coordinating the work of this family of organizations in the economic, social, cultural, educational, health and related fields."}
{"text": "My delegation believes that the Council should have more frequent and shorter sessions."}
{"text": "At each of these it could deal thoroughly with one group of subjects, covering all of its agenda over a two-year period."}
{"text": "From time to time the Council should also meet at ministerial level to review major economic or social questions when policy considerations justify participation at this level."}
{"text": "In all United Nations organs, I welcome new practices of informal consultation and negotiations through contact groups which help to turn the United Nations from a deliberative body into a real negotiating forum."}
{"text": "62.\tWe must also work for an improvement in the work of the specialized agencies."}
{"text": "Many of them have a distinguished record."}
{"text": "But our method for controlling the system as a whole has been unsatisfactory."}
{"text": "We have been good at devising new programmes, but less so at identifying ones which are obsolete or at preventing duplication."}
{"text": "One result has been an escalation of costs."}
{"text": "A few years ago one of my predecessors complained to the Assembly that the assessed budgets of the United Nations family of organizations had doubled in 10 years."}
{"text": "Now they have more than doubled in five."}
{"text": "We shall have to ensure that budgets are kept down, and that money is spent only on subjects that have the highest priority."}
{"text": "63.\tA second problem with the specialized agencies has been the extent to which they have-been turned from their main purposes to deal with the political issues which are the responsibility of this Assembly."}
{"text": "Canada is determined to resist this process."}
{"text": "We have been particularly concerned about the ILO."}
{"text": "We value that organization for its record of achievement on human rights and its unique contribution to the United Nations system as a whole."}
{"text": "We are anxious to preserve the impartiality and authority of its procedures so that a member State will not be condemned without impartial investigation."}
{"text": "I believe that many members share our views and will work together for this purpose."}
{"text": "64.\tThese proposals deal principally with improvements in our procedures."}
{"text": "If implemented, and I confess quite frankly that I am by no means sanguine that they will be, they would put us in a better position to deal with the important issues; but the complexity of the issues themselves will no: be lessened."}
{"text": "65.\t"}
{"text": "Although they manifest themselves in a variety of troubling ways, including open conflicts, it is now apparent that the principal concerns of most Members here are, in fact, economic."}
{"text": "The United Nations and its agencies have their work cut out for them if we are to move closer to a more just and equitable world economic order."}
{"text": "The barriers to success are enormous as unemployment and inflation continue to plague even the wealthiest countries."}
{"text": "Unless a spirit of reasonableness prevails, unless demands and responses are tailored to present economic realities, I must caution that even in Canada, which is far from being the least generous of the developed countries, pressures will develop to focus on our own considerable problems even to the exclusion of the international consequences."}
{"text": "I need hardly tell the Assembly that we are not alone in this difficulty."}
{"text": "66.\tCanada's goal is to build on the foundations it helped to create through its co-chairmanship of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation."}
{"text": "Given the proper climate we will work hard to devise a strategy that is both broadly acceptable and realistic."}
{"text": "In the coming weeks, Canada's representatives here and at other United Nations and related meetings will announce additional Canadian financial commitments to a large number of international organizations."}
{"text": "I shall not take time today to relate the details."}
{"text": "I do wish, however, to say a word about food aid."}
{"text": "67.\tThe world food shortage has been eased by good harvests in many countries."}
{"text": "However, the factors which gave rise to the recent crisis are still present, and, as many representatives know, recent studies concur in the likelihood of a shortfall in the next five to ten years."}
{"text": "One proposal to improve world food security concerns the idea of a 500,000-ton emergency grain reserve."}
{"text": "Canada previously announced a willingness to contribute, along with other donors."}
{"text": "I am now able to announce that, subject to Parliamentary approval, we would be willing to provide the equivalent of $7.5 million in food grain-roughly 50,000 tons or 10 per cent of the total objective."}
{"text": "68.\tAt this session we must establish the machinery for developing a new international development strategy for the third development decade."}
{"text": "This task provides us with a rare opportunity to demonstrate the continuing relevance of the United Nations."}
{"text": "We can take advantage of it, or we can allow our  deliberations to deteriorate into sterile rhetorical exchanges which will sap the goodwill of those who must give and deepen the bitterness of the receivers."}
{"text": "Let us resolve now to choose the first course."}
{"text": "69.\tSince I last spoke to this Assembly there have been important developments with respect to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea."}
{"text": "This historic Conference illustrates very well some of the best and some of the worst aspects of United Nations deliberations and processes."}
{"text": "Without the United Nations there is little doubt that management and control of the oceans and their resources would have deteriorated into anarchy."}
{"text": "The Conference is, therefore, one of the United Nations great achievements; its originators and all who have participated deserve great credit."}
{"text": "But it is an agonizingly slow process."}
{"text": "70.\tIn the past 12 months many countries, including Canada, have extended their fishing jurisdiction over living resources in their coastal waters out to 200 miles."}
{"text": "While it is true that these actions are based upon the common will of States reflected in the draft conference texts, it is also true that before that point could be reached many fish stocks had become dangerously depleted, vital elements of the world's fishing industry were jeopardized and serious confrontations developed between traditionally friendly countries."}
{"text": "71.\tThere are legitimate and complex reasons why the negotiations were difficult."}
{"text": "But we cannot ignore the fact either that old habits and patterns are hard to abandon, and it is ironic in some respects that only by acting in advance of the conclusion of the Conference did Canada and countries that took similar action enhance the United Nations and the undoubted value of the Conference."}
{"text": "This lesson should, and I hope will, lend new urgency to the important work of the Conference that remains to be completed."}
{"text": "We have taken 10 years to come this far, and the gains will be dissipated by a series of unilateral actions unless a comprehensive agreed international regime comes into force very soon."}
{"text": "72.\tIt should be self-evident, but sometimes, strangely, it is not, that all of our painfully slow progress towards a more just and well ordered society rests on the fragile assumption that we can create and preserve a peaceful world."}
{"text": "No argument should be necessary in defence of that proposition."}
{"text": "Yet we continue to witness new outbreaks of violence and to hear from leaders genuinely convinced that the only path to their objectives leads across the battlefield."}
{"text": "That belief is prevalent at present in parts of southern Africa."}
{"text": "73.\t"}
{"text": "Soon we shall be discussing the most recent plan for the attainment of majority rule in Rhodesia."}
{"text": "Canada fully supports the plan not only because we believe that it provides the basis for a fair and equitable solution but also because we reject totally the alternative of further bloodshed."}
{"text": "There must be no lessening of our resolve to see the end of the present illegal minority Rhodesian regime, and for that reason we must redouble our efforts and our commitment to peaceful means."}
{"text": "Otherwise, whatever the eventual outcome, it will have about it the smell of failure and the sad realization that good can be achieved only through death and destruction."}
{"text": "74.\t"}
{"text": "In the Middle East the issues are even more complex and the dangers to world security proportionately greater."}
{"text": "All of us are hoping that present initiatives and negotiations will prove successful and today, as in the past, Canada urges all concerned to recognize fully their awesome responsibility to make every effort and explore every avenue that can lead to a peaceful and permanent solution to longstanding differences."}
{"text": "75.\tCanada remains committed to the framework for peace embodied in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)."}
{"text": "Our support for Israel's right to exist as defined by those resolutions is firm and unequivocal."}
{"text": "We deplore, and we shall continue to do so, all efforts within this Assembly and elsewhere to attribute patently false motives to Israel or to diminish its status and rights within the United Nations or as a legitimate member of the world community."}
{"text": "76.\tCanada believes that all countries in the region need and have a right to expect more than just another cease-fire or merely a formal end to belligerency."}
{"text": "If this kind of peace is to be achieved, the crucial issues of territory must be solved."}
{"text": "The only truly secure borders-those which are freely recognized by the parties on either side of them-must be determined by negotiations within the framework of resolution 242 (1967)."}
{"text": "Until then, we believe that nothing should be done unilaterally or illegally to change or predetermine the status of any part of the occupied territories."}
{"text": "We regret that such actions are still being taken without regard to their effect on the prospects for peace."}
{"text": "It is also clear that any resolution of territorial issues, if it is indeed to bring-about the lasting peace that all desire, must provide a just, humanitarian and political solution for the Palestinian Arab people by which they can live in peace without threatening the security of any country in the region."}
{"text": "Any solution for the Palestinian Arabs must of course include their clear and unequivocal acceptance of Israel's permanent existence as their neighbour."}
{"text": "During this Assembly, we should bring our weight to bear to bring about .In early resumption of negotiations and not attempt to substitute empty debates or one-sided resolutions for the complicated, slow, but essential process of working out a settlement by the parties themselves."}
{"text": "77.\tObviously, the Middle East situation has reached a crucial stage."}
{"text": "For all concerned, these are days of opportunity."}
{"text": "We must pray that they act wisely and with a full awareness of the awful consequences of unwise actions."}
{"text": "78.\t"}
{"text": "For, whenever there is a potential for conflict these days, we must not only contemplate localized, limited hostilities, frightful as those always are."}
{"text": "We know that each new flare-up wherever it occurs in the world is a potential threat to us all and even to world survival."}
{"text": "We must remind those who would risk the use of arms that they are endangering more than the lives of their own people."}
{"text": "Every weapon fired in anger is aimed, potentially, at the heart of civilization."}
{"text": "Thus we have a right and a duty to speak out; for what is at stake's in truth the peace of Canada and of every other country in the world today."}
{"text": "79.\tBecause this is the simple truth, no problem is of greater concern to this Assembly than disarmament, but, equally, no subject has more frustrated our efforts and disappointed our peoples."}
{"text": "Next year's special session can provide us with an opportunity to move towards real disarmament."}
{"text": "Canada was a sponsor of the resolution calling for the session, and we shall put forward specific proposals to make it a success."}
{"text": "80.\tBut we cannot wait for the special session."}
{"text": "The need is immediate to improve and strengthen the international non-proliferation system, implement the non-proliferation Treaty more effectively and re-examine the risks and benefits in various nuclear cycles and processes."}
{"text": "81.\t"}
{"text": "If anything is more frightening than the prospect of rapidly escalating local hostilities, it is the nightmare of unrestrained nuclear proliferation with all its attendant horrors."}
{"text": "I find it difficult to understand how anyone among the world's leaders could consider that an expansion in the number of nuclear-weapon States would contribute to greater world stability."}
{"text": "Canada, despite its known competence in the field, rejected the nuclear-weapons option long ago."}
{"text": "Now we are making every effort to ensure that others do likewise."}
{"text": "We shall co-operate, in terms of nuclear supplies and technology, only with those countries which have signed the non-proliferation Treaty or are otherwise committed to safeguards of full scope."}
{"text": "We are encouraged by the fact that some other nuclear suppliers, including Australia and Sweden, have adopted a similar policy."}
{"text": "We hope that there will be more."}
{"text": "82.\t"}
{"text": "For Canada recognizes that, with the inevitable decline and increasing costs of conventional energy sources, much of the world will have no choice but to turn to nuclear sources to meet energy demands."}
{"text": "We appreciate also that there are legitimate differences of opinion on the question of the safest and most efficient means of utilizing nuclear resources and technology."}
{"text": "This is true even in countries whose commitment to non-proliferation is total and unquestioned."}
{"text": "83.\tCanada therefore welcomes and supports the proposal made at the London summit meeting for a thorough study of alternative fuel cycles that avoid the use of plutonium or improve safeguards."}
{"text": "We commend the United States for its initiatives in this field and hope that all countries will give it their full support."}
{"text": "This subject is much too broad and too important to be dealt with in a few moments."}
{"text": "I hope that this Assembly will provide the time for a full-scale discussion, for there can be no subject of greater importance."}
{"text": "84.\tBecause of Canada's special interest, I hope and expect that there will be an opportunity also to discuss United Nations peace-keeping activities."}
{"text": "In the Middle East, Cyprus and South Asia, United Nations peace-keeping forces or observer groups are in place."}
{"text": "Soon there may be further requests involving Zimbabwe and Namibia."}
{"text": "85.\tCanada has consistently responded to United Nations requests to provide personnel as available for peace-keeping, because we believe this to be a significant way to contribute to world peace."}
{"text": "But in Canada there is growing concern about peace keeping for two reasons."}
{"text": "First, many of the disputes which led to the need for peace-keeping forces appear no nearer to solution than they were one, two and even three decades ago."}
{"text": "We recognize that these basic and intractable problems may indeed take a lot of time and cannot be settled overnight."}
{"text": "What we wish, but do not always see, is evidence that the parties are intent on negotiating an end to their disputes."}
{"text": "Secondly, although the two most recent forces-UNEF and the UNDGF-are being property paid for through collective assessment, we have failed to reach general agreement on how future peacekeeping operations should be financed and UNFICYP is over $50 million in debt."}
{"text": "If operations are not properly funded, many Members of the United Nations will not be able to afford to provide forces-a situation which will not be healthy either for this Organization or for the concept of peace-keeping."}
{"text": "86.\t"}
{"text": "In considering future participation, Canada will weigh these two considerations: whether peace-keeping forces will contribute to a settlement rather than provide temporary relief or even contribute to a perpetuation of the problem, and whether arrangements to pay for them represent the common will of Members to assume the financial burden and permit troop contributors to be selected from a broad cross-section of countries."}
{"text": "87.\tI have no doubt we will hear a great deal about human rights during the coming months, and not only here at the United Nations."}
{"text": "Within a few days the review conference on the Final Act adopted by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at Helsinki opens in Belgrade."}
{"text": "Canada, as one of the signers of that document, will make its views known at that time."}
{"text": "88.\tBut we must also recognize that the United Nations has a major responsibility in the human rights field; one we have not always discharged fully or effectively."}
{"text": "89.\tLast year we welcomed the coming into force of the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights."}
{"text": "Paradoxically, however, at a time when these new human rights instruments have defined more fully the rights of persons in States which have ratified these instruments and have created new machinery to monitor the compliance of Member States with their legal and moral obligations the gap between the ideals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the practice of States has widened noticeably."}
{"text": "It is regrettable that only one third of the total membership of the United Nations has ratified the major human rights covenants, and that even fewer States have accepted the Optional Protocol."}
{"text": "The various monitoring and reporting procedures are too slow and cumbersome to be truly effective, and offer little tangible assistance to victims of violations."}
{"text": "90.\tMore progress can and must be made in those areas where abuses are flagrant and persistent."}
{"text": "We should direct our efforts towards finding a means of monitoring compliance with the Declaration against torture passed by the General Assembly in 1975."}
{"text": "We should improve the procedures for screening complaints and for acting on those that reflect serious abuse."}
{"text": "We should consider better procedures for co-ordination of all United Nations activity in defence of human rights."}
{"text": "91.\tWe recognize that the Charter of the United Nations obliges Member States to respect the sovereignty of others."}
{"text": "But it is surely consistent with acceptance of the principle of non-interference to urge more complete and universal recognition of other freely assumed obligations-the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedom for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion."}
{"text": "92.\tThe fact is that on this as on all the other issues I have mentioned the performance of the United Nations and of all of its Member States is being examined more closely and critically than ever before, for the sound and obvious reason that the stakes are higher than ever before."}
{"text": "93.\tI have spoken critically of some aspects of our past performance and present practices."}
{"text": "I have done so not out of any desire to weaken this Organization but because Canada is convinced that without a marked change of attitude on the part of Members and without the reforms that are so clearly necessary, the erosion of the effectiveness and prestige of the United Nations will continue."}
{"text": "94.\tWe must dedicate ourselves to work for this Organization as if our lives depended on it."}
{"text": "In truth they probably do.\n\n "}
