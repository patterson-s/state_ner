{"text": "\ufeffMr. President, it is a great pleasure for my Government to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. You represent a country which is admired by Chile and with which we enjoy historical ties of friendship and co-operation in various fields. Your acknowledged talents as a diplomat constitute a priceless guarantee of success in the conduct of the important matters to be dealt with at this session.\n138.\tWe also wish to extend our appreciation to Mr. Salim A. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania, who so wisely presided over the last session of the General Assembly, as well as other important sessions of our Organization during the year.\n139.\tSimilarly, the Government of Chile welcomes the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a country on the American continent whose independence was attained this year and which has recently become a Member of the United Nations. We hope that that nation will continue to progress on the path of peace and prosperity.\n140.\tAt the beginning of the decade of the 1980s the United Nations is entering a new and delicate stage with the maturity and fruitful experience acquired through its 35 years of existence.\n141.\tIn the course of time, peoples have developed in the most varied manner. Today there are more than 100 States which have been incorporated gradually within the grand framework of the principles and purposes embodied in our Charter. Strict observance of and faithful compliance with those principles will enable us to continue to endorse and support the legitimate aspirations to a world of peace and co-operation.\n142.\tThe evolution of this phenomenon is not alien to the United Nations. In fact, one of its great achievements has been specifically decolonization, which has led to the independence of many States and to their joining us in our common tasks.\n143.\tChile has always contributed to the efforts of the international community to find valid solutions within this Organization.\n144.\tThe world is concerned to tackle the problems which face it in the latter years of the twentieth century. Chile shares that concern and it is its national objective to focus on the challenges it presents.\n145.\tOn several occasion my Government has informed the Assembly of the reform has introduced in the economic, social, juridical, labour and educational fields, inter alia, with a view to adapting their structures to the requirements of our time. However, this task could not be accomplished in the absence of a system of coexistence and a dynamic, secure and stable Government. Peoples cannot remain static.\n146.\tThe Government of Chile has, since 11 September 1973, repeatedly reaffirmed its intention to begin a new era in the history of our homeland, designing with an eye to the future the structures of a stable and creative political regime. It has further stated that the new system of institutions developing in the country would be entrusted with establishing the legal framework for the great collective task to which the nation is committed.\n147.\tAccordingly, one of the first steps taken by the Government was to entrust a committee, composed of university professors of various democratic ideological tendencies, with the task of drawing up a draft political constitution. Over 100 representatives of the most diverse activities, including professional, union and youth leaders, collaborated in that work, contributing their ideas and their concerns.\n148.\tAfter five years of thorough legal and political studies, including the consideration of the most modern constitutional texts, the committee studying the question of a new constitution presented to the Government the preliminary draft of a fundamental charter.\n149.\tThe State Council, a body made up of national representatives at the highest level, including former Presidents of the Republic, former magistrates of the higher courts of justice, former rectors of universities and union leaders, reviewed the preliminary constitution. In order to carry out its task properly, the Council requested wide-ranging collaboration, and many suggestions were received.\n150.\tThe conclusions reached by the State Council after over one and a half years of analysis were presented to the President of the Republic. Finally, the head of State and the Government Junta drafted the final text of the constitution which, as had been previously promised, was submitted to a plebiscite for approval.\n151.\tThe Chilean public followed the development and preparation of the new political constitution step by step. Both the preliminary draft prepared by the committee on studies and the draft prepared by the State Council, as well as the final text of the new Constitution, were duly published, giving rise at every stage to wide and active discussion on the part of the different sectors of national life in Chile.\n152.\tThe public debate held during the period just prior to the plebiscite was particularly intense. In that debate supporters and opponents of the new constitutional text and of the Government's action expressed their views for or against in public rallies, with complete freedom and full publicity. The mass communications media, domestic and foreign, published and informed the country and the world of the individual and collective views of all Chileans.\n153.\tOn 11 September, in conditions of freedom, secrecy and full information, a plebiscite was held throughout the Republic so that the Chilean people might decide on the approval or rejection of the proposed political Constitution.\n154.\tIn a country of 11 million inhabitants, 6,300,000 citizens voted. This represents the highest participation ever known in our national history.\n155.\tAll Chileans over 18 years of age, men and women without any discrimination whatsoever, fulfilled this duty which, in accordance with Chile's political tradition, is mandatory. Foreign residents also voted, inasmuch as they share in the life of the nation.\n156.\tMore than 4,200,000 citizens voted in favour of the new Constitution, that is, over 67 per cent of the voters. Approximately 1,800,000, that is, 30 per cent, voted against it. Votes declared null and void amounted to only 2.77 per cent.\n157.\tNo one can contend that there was a lack of opportunity or means to express, with complete freedom, opinions for or against the constitutional text, and to participate in the debate. No one can truthfully hold that there was no access to each of the steps of the balloting process. No one can in good faith state that, on account of regulatory or technical circumstances or legal restrictions, he or she was deprived of the right to vote. No one who thinks dispassionately can doubt the legitimacy, legality and correct conduct of the plebiscite.\n158.\tChile is a country which is noted for its constitutional stability. In a period of over 150 years of independence, Chile has had only two constitutions: those of 1833 and 1925. Today, we have approved a new fundamental law which, taking in the principles of freedom and democracy enshrined in the preceding constitutions, aims at organizing that stable and creative political regime needed to meet the vital challenge of the years to come.\n159.\tThe political Constitution of 1980 contains, in general terms, some solutions not usually provided for in contemporary fundamental charters, aimed at solving the problems of the Chilean individual of our times.\n160.\tAs regards the crucial dilemma of the individual versus the State, it provides for the principle of subsidiary status of the State, thus limiting the latter's action in order to prevent its interference in areas which are basically left to the free initiative and action of individuals.\n161.\tOn those grounds, the Constitution of 1980 is directed towards defining the field of action of the rulers and ensuring the freedoms of those governed.\n162.\tIt further enshrines all the rights of man, as established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights, and provides the means required by individuals in order to ensure that their rights are fully respected.\n163.\tAnother basic characteristic of the political charter is the effective attempt to secure the participation of the people, based on methods designed to bring the people closer to their rulers and to enable the latter to have the opportunity of learning the opinion of those governed.\n164.\tLikewise, under the rule of the Constitution of 1980, Chile continues to be a democratic republic and its authorities are chosen by means of free, secret and informed elections. It establishes, once again, the traditional separation of the powers of the State and especially the independence and the immutability of the judiciary, which is created in an autonomous manner, a prime guarantee for the respect of the legal order.\n165.\tJust as the new Constitution endeavours to protect the individual from possible abuses by the State and the authorities, it also aims at protecting the individual from one of the most serious scourges of our contemporary times, that is, violence used as a tool for political conviction, in other words, terrorism. The General Assembly has been dealing with this distressing problem of the twentieth century, this ultimate denial of human rights.\n166.\tThe fundamental charter of Chile explicitly defines the preaching of violence and the practice of terrorism as a constitutional crime and entrusts the investigation, trial and punishment of such acts to the courts of justice.\n167.\tThe aforementioned results of the plebiscite are unequivocal: over 4 million Chileans, that is, 67 per cent of the voters, have decided that the first presidential term of office of eight years, with which the new Constitution enters into force, is to be entrusted to General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte. These figures grant the Government the highest representation registered in the political history of our country.\n168.\tThe President of the Republic, faithfully interpreting this legitimate will of the nation, once the results of the plebiscite were known, affirmed that there were neither winners nor losers and called upon all Chileans to unite in order to continue striving for the prosperity of the country and, most especially, for the economically weaker sectors.\n169.\tAt the beginning of my statement I said that the world was concerned over problems which should be resolved in the last two remaining decades of this century. Those problems are numerous, diverse and serious. The most complex and dangerous ones stem from political situations or from social-economic behaviour, in addition to other problems stemming from religious, doctrinaire or ideological beliefs.\n170.\tApproximately one year ago the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. The urgent meetings of the Security Council and the emergency special session of the General Assembly, which condemned that intervention, have proved to be futile in resolving that situation. Neither have the appeals for respect for the most elementary human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Afghanistan achieved their purposes. We have witnessed with amazement the intervention in that small country of one of the super-Powers which, because of its military might appears to feel itself invulnerable in the face of the outcry of the international community.\n171.\tThe tragedy affecting that country is eloquently evidenced by the Afghan refugees who are fleeing to Pakistan and whose fate deserves priority consideration by this Organization. Chile shares that concern.\n172.\tUnfortunately, the case of Afghanistan is not unique. We have witnessed, with distress, the bloody and lengthy struggle of the people of Kampuchea.\n173.\tThe millions of refugees, whose sad story has made an impact on international public opinion, necessarily constitute another humanitarian problem of vital importance for the United Nations. Chile, as in the case of the refugees of Afghanistan, has contributed in so far as possible to the efforts made to resolve this situation. We trust that the generous assistance provided by countries actually reaches those for whom it is intended and who need it so badly. We most sincerely appreciate the work accomplished by the international organizations and other entities, such as the International Red Cross, engaged in this noble humanitarian task.\n174.\tIt will soon be one year since the unusual problem of the diplomatic hostages in Iran began. We note the continued breach of the most basic rights and immunities en-shrined in numerous international instruments.\n175.\tThe crisis in the Middle East continues to be one of the political situations which cause the most pressure and which most threaten the peace of the world.\n176.\tThe recent seventh special session of the General Assembly testifies to the priority assigned by the international community to the solution of the Middle East problem and its main element, the question of Palestine.\n177.\tThe Government of Chile supports without reservation the endeavour of the United Nations to find an urgent solution to the crisis in the Middle East. It believes, likewise, that all efforts towards peace in that region should be welcomed and encouraged by the entire international community.\n178.\tA realistic solution should be based on the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied territories, on the acknowledgement of the right of the States of the region, including Israel, to live within secure and recognized boundaries and on the full exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of a sovereign and an independent State, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, especially those of the Security Council.\n179.\tWe are concerned over the situation in Lebanon, a State with which we have close ties of friendship. Many sons on that land are of Chilean nationality. We support the efforts of the Government of Lebanon to achieve peace, unity and prosperity, as well as the important work performed by this Organization in that country.\n180.\tAs regards the grave situation which has arisen between Iran and Iraq, my Government wishes to put on record its support for the appeal issued by the Security Council, through its resolution 479 (1980), to end the conflict and bring about a peaceful settlement in accordance with the principles of justice and international law.\n181.\tOn the African continent, my country has been particularly pleased to witness the birth of the State of Zimbabwe, after so many years of struggle and suffering. For us, it is historical evidence of the positive mission which can and should be carried out by the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of international disputes whenever the parties show goodwill and a readiness to reach an agreement. My Government cannot fail to express its appreciation to those who have made this achievement possible, especially the people of Zimbabwe and the Government of the United Kingdom, whose flexibility and determination have brought the Lancaster House agreements to a happy conclusion.\n182.\tWhile expressing our best wishes for the well-being of the people of Zimbabwe and for its progress on the path of freedom, development and social progress, we trust that it may serve as an example in other unresolved situations, such as the case of Namibia. In this regard we call on the parties to make it possible for the Security Council plan for Namibia to be carried out.\n183.\tOur firm support for decolonization and the self- determination of peoples is accompanied by our forceful condemnation of all types of racial discrimination, including apartheid, and of all foreign intervention in the solution of Africa's problems.\n184.\tWe share with our sister countries in Latin America a common destiny towards which we must advance guided by common principles and values. We must unite our efforts in positive action for the benefit of all peoples. The closer relations among our nations, the increase in trade and the regional co-operation are all pointing in that direction.\n185.\tWe are glad to observe such tendencies on the continent. The meeting held at Montevideo last August, which gave rise to the Association for Latin American Integration and which I had the honour to attend, is eloquent evidence of that spirit of co-operation.\n186.\tHowever, we cannot conceal our concern over the foreign intervention and the escalation of terrorism in some regions of America. We wish to see the American continent free from the scourge of terrorism and of totalitarian ideologies\u2014so alien to its historical and cultural traditions\u2014which imperialist interests are attempting to introduce in the region for hegemonistic purposes.\n187.\tThe international community has witnessed how Chile, faithful to its tradition of using peaceful means to settle international disputes, had recourse to the mediation of His Holiness Pope John Paul II in connection with the dispute with the sister republic of Argentina.\n188.\tThus on 8 January 1979 both countries signed the Montevideo Agreement, through which they agreed to request the mediation of His Holiness and solemnly undertook not to resort to the threat or use of force in their mutual relations.\n189.\tUnder the lofty guidance of that august mediator, the parties submitted their respective positions and conducted active negotiations aimed at finding points of agreement so as to facilitate a just and definitive solution to the controversy.\n190.\tChile has emphasized and now reaffirms its appreciation of the noble mediating task performed by His Holiness the Pope and expresses its trust in that high office.\n191.\tMy country is confident that the solution of the controversy of concern to us must be found on the basis of the mutual readiness and the goodwill of the Governments to unite in their efforts for the well-being of their peoples and of full respect for the rules of international law and the agreements and commitments we have signed, which constitute the foundation for harmonious relations between States.\n192.\tIn this decade the world is facing increasingly urgent economic problems. The solution to those problems, which has so long been postponed, cannot be set aside indefinitely.\n193.\tOur indecisiveness concerning the need for structural changes offers the prospect of a grim future characterized by slow economic growth, high rates of inflation and increased unemployment in developed and developing countries alike.\n194.\tThe international community, despite the diverse and complex problems facing it, should not forget the sufferings of millions of human beings who are experiencing extreme poverty in the lower income countries. We all share that responsibility. This is Chile's understanding.\n195.\tNone the less, international co-operation is weakened by the decreasing flows of financial aid, the alarming increase in protectionist and discriminatory barriers against exports from the developing countries and the persistent instability imposed today by international currency conditions.\n196.\tDuring the 1950s and part of the 1960s, the world economy was surprisingly prosperous. To a great extent, this was accounted for by the more liberal economic policies of the developed nations and their favourable impact on the increase in international trade. However, those same nations which in the past promoted free trade are now, paradoxically, supporting a sort of \"organized free trade\", involving protectionist measures and commitments for \"self-limitation of exports\".\n197.\tMy country regards the subject of energy as a fundamental element in the restructuring of present international economic relations.\n198.\tThe developing countries have been doubly affected by the sudden rise in the price of energy, inasmuch as we have felt its direct impact through our hydrocarbon imports and have had to absorb the increase in prices of manufactured goods, resulting from the adjustment policies of the industrialized countries.\n199.\tMy Government deems it vitally important to support all feasible initiatives aimed at channelling funds to finance investments and provide needed assistance for the development of conventional and non-conventional sources of energy in the developing countries, especially in those where there is a considerable shortfall in domestic oil production.\n200.\tThe facts I have mentioned and the far from satisfactory results of the eleventh special session of the General Assembly prompt us to affirm the need for greater political will on the part of the developed countries. We appeal to them to realize the importance of their role in solving inter-national economic problems and in the growth of the developing countries.\n201.\tWe, the countries of the third world, must also contribute with our efforts and our dedication to maintain our economies, ensuring that resources are not uselessly squandered and making it possible for our entire populations to share in the benefits of development.\n202.\tThat is my Government's understanding of the position and five years ago it began a process of restructuring which enabled it to adjust to changes in the world economy, thus avoiding the maintenance of obsolete systems of production regardless of cost.\n203.\tThis development has been characterized by a higher growth rate than obtained in the past and by increased economic independence. The overall growth of Chile's economy during the period 1976 to 1980 amounted to 40 per cent.\n204.\tMoreover, the Government of Chile has assigned top priority to the redistributive role which the State should play for the benefit of the neediest, since the 1970 census revealed that 21 per cent of Chileans lived in conditions of dire poverty.\n205.\tIn order to overcome this tragic social and economic situation\u2014which is shared by many of our nations\u2014and to permit the inhabitants of the country equitably to share in the benefits offered by economic development, my Government has considerably increased its social expenditures, including financing of programmes in the fields of health, nutrition, education, housing and social security.\n206.\tThus, social expenditure has been increased from 27 per cent of Government spending in 1973 to 53 per cent in 1980.\n207.\tSignificant social progress has been achieved, and this is due to the stability of our Government system and to the implementation of an economic policy which has proved to be sound and successful.\n208.\tMy country, which is greatly interested in the outcome of negotiations on the new convention on the law of the sea, wishes to pay a heartfelt tribute to the author of the first Declaration on the 200-mile maritime zone, the recently deceased former President of Chile, Mr. Gabriel Gonzalez Videla, who had the visionary foresight to proclaim, on 23 June 1947, a principle which is today universally accepted.\n209.\tThat statesmanly action, which places him among the pioneers and precursors of the new law of the sea, gave rise to the Declaration of Santiago of 19526 on the maritime zone of the countries of the South Pacific linking Chile, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. Furthermore, this Declaration is one of the bases for the vast process of revision of the law of the sea, a process which culminated in the adoption and signing, at Caracas, of a universal convention on the subject.\n210.\tThe important conclusions reached at the ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, especially in connection with questions on the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the area of national jurisdiction, cause us to look forward optimistically to the completion of the broad task undertaken by the United Nations over 10 years ago.\n211.\tIn the face of this extended attempt to achieve consensus in the international community, we cannot but voice our rejection of the unilateral adoption of national laws favouring the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the area of national jurisdiction. These laws lack all validity with regard to the international community. My country endorses the protests raised by, among others, the countries of the South Pacific and of the Group of 77.\n212.\tAt the dawn of this new decade, we reaffirm our unlimited support for and commitment to the fundamental principles of the United Nations which the Charter has enshrined as indispensable for peaceful coexistence in the international community.\n213.\tAmong other principles, we place emphasis on equal rights, the sovereign equality of States, the fulfilment in good faith of obligations undertaken, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, the self-determination of peoples and international co-operation.\n214.\tWe know that this task is difficult. We know that some States pay lip-service to these principles without ever having honoured them; we know that they distort them in order to use them against other States whose political regimes constitute barriers to their hegemonistic endeavours. We know too that however difficult the task it must never be abandoned. That is Chile's resolve.\n\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "CHL_35_1980", "year": 1980}, "spans": [{"start": 209, "end": 214, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 40, "token_end": 41}, {"start": 533, "end": 564, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 102, "token_end": 107}, {"start": 743, "end": 748, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 143, "token_end": 144}, {"start": 776, "end": 789, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 148, "token_end": 150}, {"start": 827, "end": 835, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 158, "token_end": 159}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1903, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 361, "token_end": 362}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2139, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 404, "token_end": 405}, {"start": 2665, "end": 2670, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 508, "token_end": 509}, {"start": 4497, "end": 4504, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 838, "token_end": 839}, {"start": 4896, "end": 4901, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 909, "token_end": 910}, {"start": 5473, "end": 5488, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1015, "token_end": 1018}, {"start": 5498, "end": 5505, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1020, "token_end": 1021}, {"start": 5883, "end": 5888, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1091, "token_end": 1092}, {"start": 6805, "end": 6810, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1280, "token_end": 1281}, {"start": 6920, "end": 6925, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1302, "token_end": 1303}, {"start": 7428, "end": 7435, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1394, "token_end": 1395}, {"start": 8519, "end": 8524, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1601, "token_end": 1602}, {"start": 9375, "end": 9380, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1759, "token_end": 1760}, {"start": 10789, "end": 10805, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2015, "token_end": 2018}, {"start": 10814, "end": 10825, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2019, "token_end": 2020}, {"start": 11135, "end": 11146, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2072, "token_end": 2073}, {"start": 11473, "end": 11479, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2132, "token_end": 2133}, {"start": 11586, "end": 11591, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2149, "token_end": 2150}, {"start": 11645, "end": 11656, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2163, "token_end": 2164}, {"start": 11755, "end": 11764, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2184, "token_end": 2185}, {"start": 11961, "end": 11966, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2220, "token_end": 2221}, {"start": 12002, "end": 12013, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2230, "token_end": 2231}, {"start": 12369, "end": 12374, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2292, "token_end": 2293}, {"start": 12503, "end": 12507, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2320, "token_end": 2321}, {"start": 13006, "end": 13015, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2414, "token_end": 2415}, {"start": 13040, "end": 13045, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2423, "token_end": 2424}, {"start": 13377, "end": 13383, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2484, "token_end": 2485}, {"start": 13494, "end": 13500, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2505, "token_end": 2506}, {"start": 13608, "end": 13619, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2525, "token_end": 2526}, {"start": 13850, "end": 13857, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2568, "token_end": 2569}, {"start": 13942, "end": 13949, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2588, "token_end": 2589}, {"start": 14007, "end": 14014, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2599, "token_end": 2600}, {"start": 14194, "end": 14198, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2635, "token_end": 2636}, {"start": 14203, "end": 14207, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2637, "token_end": 2638}, {"start": 14576, "end": 14584, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2709, "token_end": 2710}, {"start": 15005, "end": 15013, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2784, "token_end": 2785}, {"start": 15040, "end": 15054, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2790, "token_end": 2792}, {"start": 15233, "end": 15241, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2826, "token_end": 2827}, {"start": 15413, "end": 15420, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2861, "token_end": 2862}, {"start": 15514, "end": 15521, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2881, "token_end": 2882}, {"start": 16532, "end": 16539, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3076, "token_end": 3077}, {"start": 16560, "end": 16568, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3083, "token_end": 3084}, {"start": 16844, "end": 16849, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3129, "token_end": 3130}, {"start": 17557, "end": 17562, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3259, "token_end": 3260}, {"start": 18807, "end": 18812, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3484, "token_end": 3485}, {"start": 21473, "end": 21478, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3959, "token_end": 3960}, {"start": 21578, "end": 21583, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3983, "token_end": 3984}, {"start": 22782, "end": 22787, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4213, "token_end": 4214}, {"start": 23154, "end": 23159, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4286, "token_end": 4287}, {"start": 23161, "end": 23169, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4288, "token_end": 4289}, {"start": 25304, "end": 25309, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4686, "token_end": 4687}]}

The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals reflect the will, no less \ndetermined, of our generation to confront extreme \npoverty once and for all, so that we may leave to our \n  \n \n08-51851 24 \n \nchildren a world without millions of human beings \nsuffering from hunger and poverty on a daily basis. \n Together, the observance of human rights and the \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals are \nperhaps the most noble aspirations ever envisioned by \nhumanity, and the most devoted to the dignity of \nindividuals. \n Just by that fact alone, we can say that, despite all \nof the suffering deliberately caused by human beings \nover the last decades, during that time we have learned \nand we have made progress. We can feel satisfied that \nwe have identified and broadened the horizons of \nhuman beings on our planet. We can feel satisfied by \nthat, but by no means should we be complacent. \n There is no room for complacency because if we \nlook at the horizon for the MDGs, as we have for \nhuman rights, the conclusion would be the same: the \nresults are still far from fulfilling our aspirations, \nprecisely because those aspirations retain all of their \nvalue, and even grow in value, with the passage of \ntime. \n Ten years ago, at the commemoration of the \nfiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, President Nelson \nMandela recalled that poverty is an offence against the \nDeclaration and is the result not of any force of nature, \nbut rather of the action or non-action by human beings, \nin particular those in leadership positions in politics, \nthe economy and other areas of human activity. \n Aware of that responsibility, eight years ago \nMember States undertook the unique effort, in historic \nterms, to alleviate poverty for millions of people \nworldwide. I wish to make my opinion clear that we \nhave not progressed as we should have or as we \nplanned. However, the needs are the same or even \ngreater than they were when we agreed the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals eight years ago. \n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n If we are to attain the Millennium Development \nGoals by 2015, we cannot just sit back. We cannot \nblame our failure to meet our obligations on the \neconomic situation. We cannot use any circumstance as \nan excuse to avoid honouring our commitments. It is a \nquestion not only of adhering to irreplaceable ethical \nstandards, but of making responsible efforts towards \nstability and international equality. \n We must also work urgently to establish a new \nworld financial order that would prevent the recurrence \nof situations like that we are currently experiencing. It \nis also urgent that we continue to fight with \ndetermination against the hunger and poverty that \ncause millions of people to suffer unacceptably and \ncontinue to be a source of conflict and migratory \npressures that are difficult to control. \n I am speaking on behalf of a country \u2014 Spain \u2014 \nthat is making great efforts of solidarity in its \ncooperation policies. Over the past four years, Spain \nhas been the State with the highest increase in its \nofficial development assistance; our goal is to reach \n0.7 per cent of our gross national income by 2012. \nSpanish society offers that commitment in response to \nthe current food crisis. \n My country believes that the best way to reaffirm \nthe full value of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and to keep 2015 firmly in view is to strengthen \nthe historical connotation of each. That connotation is \nnothing less than the exaltation of human dignity as \nboth an impregnable wall against arbitrariness and \ndespotism and as a curb against extreme poverty. \n A few weeks ago, on behalf of the Government of \nSpain, I made a proposal that I would like to reiterate \ntoday. The year 2015 should be designated as the year \nof a universal moratorium on the death penalty. That \nwould be a first step towards its abolition. I call upon \nrepresentatives of countries that still include capital \npunishment in their legal system to support the \nmeasure and to participate in a process of reflection on \nthe meaning of that punishment inflicted by States. It \nmight seen utopian to aspire to achieve the full \nenjoyment and universal recognition of human rights \nand the eradication of extreme poverty in the course of \na single generation, but those goals are not utopian and \nnever will be. Utopias are often simply premature \ntruths. We must not delay or dismiss them with \nresignation or blind selfishness. Moreover, it is only by \nsetting off down that road that we can work towards \nthe just, secure and cooperative international order that \nwe all wish to see. \n The effects of the international financial crisis \nthat began one year ago are spreading throughout most \ndeveloped and less developed economies, and could \naffect the achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals. There is a risk that the poorest countries will \nend up suffering even more because of improper \n \n \n25 08-51851 \n \npractices in the richer countries. The financial crisis \nhas conclusively demonstrated the need to reconsider \neconomic environments that are immune to regulation \nand governmental supervision. We already know what \nspeculation in the crucible of deregulation can lead to. \nToday, it is more important than ever to stress the role \nof institutions and Government in rationalizing the \nmarkets and their instrumentality in serving the real \nneeds of families, the well-being of individuals and \ntheir education, health care and social cohesion.  \n At the national level, the State protects markets \nfrom their own excesses. The global market lacks \nsimilar institutions to develop control and supervision \nfunctions. We need to revise the rules and institutions \nof the world economy. We need a common vision for \nthe establishment of a new international financial legal \nsystem. We have to learn from our mistakes, and do so \nquickly and in a spirit of cooperation. \n My Government would like to contribute actively \nto forging that new international financial order. We \nwill promote and support an agreement that contains \ndefinite commitments to supervision, transparency and \nearly warning by national institutions; ensures the \nflexible capacity of those institutions to provide \nliquidity and countercyclical reserves of capital to the \nmarkets in moments of need; and strengthens the role \nof international financial bodies. \n Prosperity for our peoples is possible only if there \nis international peace and security. Peace and security \nwill be possible only through effective multilateralism \nbased on respect for and the safeguarding of \ninternational law. For my country, there is no other way \nto imagine international order. Four years ago in this \nvery same Hall, I proposed an alliance of civilizations \nwith the objective of building bridges between \ndifferent cultures and breaking down the walls of \nmisunderstanding. Today, I am satisfied to note that the \ninitiative promoted by Spain and Turkey has been fully \nendorsed by the United Nations, and enjoys the support \nof a Group of Friends made up of 90 States and \ninternational organizations. \n The world can hope for peace only when dialogue \nand understanding of basic values that respect diversity \nare elevated above intolerance and fundamentalism.  \n Spain will continue to assert this conviction in all \nforums where our contribution is or can be relevant \u2014 \nincluding, first and foremost, at the United Nations. We \nwill do so not only because it is the best way to stress \nthe key desires of Spanish society, but also because we \nwant to shoulder our responsibility for bringing about \nthe just, secure, caring international order in which we \nbelieve.  \n The capacity for human progress cannot be \nquestioned. The thirst for discovery and innovation, the \ndesire to go beyond ourselves, opens the door for \nmeeting human needs every day in all areas. It is a \nquestion of placing this immense creative force in the \nservice of those values on which human dignity is \nbased, eliminating arbitrariness, injustice and all forms \nof discrimination, starting with those that women have \nso unfairly endured throughout history. We cannot \nstop; we cannot give up.  \n In the United Nations, with a rational attitude, \nwith the hope engendered by our common values, we \ncan launch an era of world prosperity and unity. For \nthat, we need coordination, not unilateral action. \nDevelopment must be sustainable and not uncontrolled. \nWe need permanent political dialogue. We should not \ngive in to old temptations or new cold wars. We have \nto eradicate extreme poverty and denounce the \nselfishness of the richest. We need the United Nations. \nWe need all men and women to know that their dignity \nis dependent on the dignity of their peers.  \n Above all, hundreds of millions of people in \nAfrica, Latin America and Asia need us: that must be \nthe basic purpose of our endeavours. Spain is \ncommitted to those endeavours and will fulfil its \nhistoric duty to eradicate extreme poverty around the \nworld. This generation can do it; this generation must \ndo it.

{"text": "80. Mr. President, when I visited Romania early this year I not only was charmed by your country but I was also impressed with the political views expressed by Romanian statesmen, especially yourself. That impression was strengthened by our subsequent discussions in the Netherlands during the month of July. Your virtually unanimous election as President of this Assembly is therefore most gratifying to me, and I extend my warm congratulations to your country and to yourself.\n\n81. My Government, to a large degree, shares the many concerns expressed in the Annual Report of the Secretary-General [A/6701], The war in Viet-Nam in particular continues to stir our conscience. Today, more than ever before, the mass media confront us with the sufferings of a divided nation whose citizens want to live in peace and freedom, but who are torn by civil strife, terrorism and acts of war.\n\n82. Every time a shot finds its mark, a bomb explodes on its target, or a political murder is committed, new sufferings are inflicted on that unhappy country. It is therefore imperative that honest attempts at finding a peaceful solution be earnestly studied by the party to which they are addressed instead of being scornfully and peremptorily rejected. Countless speakers before me have advocated a reconvening of the Geneva Conference, a conference which at the time proved to be a forum for constructive discussions. I join in their appeal. The Viet-Nam question calls for discussions and negotiations, In this context I was pleased to note that important Governments involved are prepared to move in that direction. I call to mind, for example, the statements made by Mr. George Brown [567th meeting], Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, who was one of the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and the expressed readiness on the part of the United States, so specifically stated by Ambassador Goldberg [562nd meeting], to sit down at the conference table and to accept a Security Council decision opening the way to a Geneva Conference. On the other hand, it is most regrettable that the other Co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union, seems as yet unwilling to co-operate towards such a procedure.\n\n83. The people of the Netherlands are by now so deeply worried about the war in Viet-Nam that they felt the need to give a solemn expression to their apprehensions. Towards the end of August last, the Lower House of the Netherlands Parliament spent a full day debating Viet-Nam, and every one of our political parties participated. My Government shares the grave concern expressed on that occasion by our Parliament, as well as its view that the Viet-Nam question calls for a political rather than a military solution. The House adopted a motion calling, inter alia, for a cessation of the bombing of North Viet-Nam in order to increase the possibility of peace negotiations. The member of Parliament who introduced the motion explained in an oral statement that the requested\u2003cessation of the bombing should not be subject to pre-conditions.\n\n84. My Government believes that the present situation must not be allowed to continue. It has therefore appealed to all parties to the conflict to break through the existing vicious circle and to adopt a policy leading to peace by accepting, as a first step, to go to the conference table. I now publicly reiterate this appeal on behalf of my country.\n\n85. Much has been said in the course of this debate on the diminished ability of the United Nations to maintain world peace. Since the United Nations cannot be more than the combined aspirations of its Members, it goes without saying that what our Organization is able or unable to accomplish in the service of world peace reflects but the limits to which the Members are prepared to go for the furtherance of peace. Moreover, the United Nations is not designed to be used as an immediate court of complaint for every kind of violation against the international community.\n\n86. The normal procedure, as laid down by the Charter, is for countries first to try and settle their own disputes directly. I can do no better than to quote verbatim the wise words in the Introduction to the Secretary-General's Annual Report when he says: \"I believe it is necessary to draw attention to the urgent need for States to have wider recourse, in their relations with other States, to the various means for the pacific settlement of disputes.\" [A/ 6701/Add.1, para. 155.] Only when every other avenue to peace has been explored without success, and a dangerous situation develops, are we justified in calling upon the United Nations \u2014 but even then we can do so only within the terms of the Charter.\n\n87. We know that our Organization must cope with many and varied effects of growth. One such effect is the unforeseen increase in the number of sovereign States. A gathering of more than 120 Member States functions very differently from and less effectively than an assembly comprising no more than fifty or sixty members. However much our contemporary sense of justice may have been gratified by the speedy process of decolonization, the problem of very small countries whose voice and vote are out of proportion to their position in the world is real and as yet unsolved. The Introduction to the Secretary- General's Annual Report is well worth reading on this point.\n\n88. There are more such phenomena that seem to call for changes in our organization and procedures. Perhaps improved instruments for peace and security will lead to their better use. We might, for example, take a more critical view of certain kinds of decisions and paper resolutions that in fact do the world more harm than good because they cannot be implemented. They are wafted away on the wind of history almost as soon as they are written. Not only is it better to make no decision at all than to make one that is meaningless or unenforceable; it is also good to realize that the euphoria surrounding such resolutions and voting sometimes represents a flight from reality; the underlying problem remains unsolved.\n \n89. A most striking example of this is the situation in the Middle East. For twenty years we have discussed the problems of this area without coming to grips with the real issues. As a result the world has just witnessed the tragedy of a war that should have been avoided. Once again, in this Assembly, the Middle East is on our agenda. The situation at issue is one which clearly threatens world peace. Therefore, we feel that the Assembly should discuss this question with restraint, because it is a problem which falls under the competence of the Security Council. Our hope is for a concerted effort by all parties to create a new and stable order in the Middle East, making possible the peaceful co-existence of countries and nations with all of whom we have age-old ties of close co-operation and friendship; nations whose civilizations, wisdom and spiritual contributions to the world have been most impressive.\n\n90. The positions taken by the various parties to the dispute during the present debate are rigid, and understandably so. But understanding is not enough. It is conceivable that the traumatic events of last summer will bring about new patterns of thought that may bring us closer to a solution. In a part of the world where so much intellectual energy is concentrated, the creation of new structures must be possible. To continue aggravating present differences in the General Assembly seems pointless. Speaking for my Government, I recommend an early debate in the Security Council and a strengthening of the United Nations peace-keeping role in the area. We support all initiatives to this end: the appointment of a special representative of the Secretary-General, observers and \u2014 when desired and accepted by both sides \u2014 a United Nations buffer force to give extra guarantees against a new explosion.\n\n91. All such measures will have our full support, and if necessary we are prepared to assist in guaranteeing permanent frontiers, security arrangements, and free passage through International waterways. Our views regarding the fundamentals of the question were presented in Itemized detail in my address of 28 June last, during the fifth emergency special session [1539th meeting], and remain unchanged; so I shall not repeat those seven points. I do wish, however, to point out once again, though the fact is well known to everybody, that neither a detente nor a lasting solution will be possible in the Middle East unless, in addition to the two parties, the major Powers come to mutually acceptable terms.\n\n92. That a consensus between major Powers is possible, even when the subject matter is difficult and complex, Is evident from the near-completion of a draft non-proliferation treaty. The attention of all of us is now directed towards current efforts aimed at a speedy presentation of that treaty. My delegation earnestly hopes that the Soviet Union and the United States will be able to submit the full text of such a draft treaty before this session of the Assembly Is over and that it will cover the question of safeguards. My Government would greatly value a treaty based on effective inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and believes such a treaty could be implemented without being contrary to the provisions of the Euratom Treaty. On our part we will do everything to promote such fundamental agreement with respect to the as yet unwritten article on inspection.\n\n93. We do Indeed attach very great importance to such a treaty, though we naturally realize that it would not be a panacea and that may other measures will remain necessary if we are to stop the nuclear arms race. If we fail to halt the spread of nuclear weapons to a growing number of countries, there will be little cause to hope for an early progress in arms control and disarmament. We therefore regard a non-proliferation treaty as an essential step towards a stable and secure world. As for the nuclear Powers, they should likewise exercise self-restraint and they should limit their own vertical proliferation.\n\n94. It would be improper to discuss the question of security without mentioning the problem of stagnation in world prosperity. In a world where poverty is rampant security treaties are not enough, because poverty is just as explosive as the atom bomb. Co-operation between developed and developing countries is a problem that strongly appeals to all sectors of Dutch society. In its budget proposals for 1968, submitted to Parliament about a week ago, my Government announced a substantial increase in foreign aid as well as a greatly activated development policy. My colleague in the Netherlands Government in charge of development aid will speak more extensively on this important subject later during this Assembly.\n\n95. Mr. President and fellow representatives, may God grant us during this Assembly the wisdom to accomplish some good for humanity.\n\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "NLD_22_1967", "year": 1967}, "spans": [{"start": 620, "end": 624, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 115, "token_end": 116}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1439, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 269, "token_end": 270}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1443, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 271, "token_end": 272}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1732, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 323, "token_end": 325}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1855, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 349, "token_end": 351}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2149, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 405, "token_end": 408}, {"start": 2295, "end": 2299, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 440, "token_end": 441}, {"start": 2484, "end": 2492, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 476, "token_end": 479}, {"start": 2661, "end": 2665, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 510, "token_end": 511}, {"start": 2666, "end": 2669, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 512, "token_end": 513}, {"start": 2822, "end": 2827, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 542, "token_end": 544}, {"start": 8191, "end": 8199, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1555, "token_end": 1556}, {"start": 8959, "end": 8975, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1706, "token_end": 1709}, {"start": 8980, "end": 8997, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1710, "token_end": 1713}]}
{"text": "First, I would like to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Treki on his election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \nsession. Afghanistan looks forward to working with \nhim over the next year and to strengthening \ninternational responses to the crises that we are facing \ntoday. \n Since its inception the United Nations has been \ninstrumental in addressing the world\u2019s challenges, \nparticularly in the global South. But significant \nchallenges remain unresolved. The growing gap \nbetween and within nations in terms of opportunity and \nprosperity reminds us that we are still far from meeting \nthe ideals and objectives of the Charter of the United \nNations for creating a just and secure world. \n Strengthening and restructuring United Nations \nagencies remain pivotal in closing the gap between the \nobjectives of the Charter and the realities of the world. \nThe United Nations is not a forum for lip service. It \nmust embody the ideals of the Charter by providing \npolitical and moral direction and leadership. In our \nincreasingly interdependent world and the \nmultilaterally oriented international system, the United \nNations must assume greater responsibility for finding \ncollective solutions to our challenges.  \n The world, and in particular developing nations, is \nfaced with the threat of poverty, underdevelopment, \nenvironmental degradation, extremism, fundamentalism, \nterrorism, culturally based racism, the spread of weapons \nof mass destruction and the arms race. Rather than just \nmanaging and reacting to problems, the United Nations \nmust find ways to address the structural causes of the \nworld\u2019s problems and conflicts. To this end, closer \ncooperation between the United Nations, the \nInternational Criminal Court, international financial \norganizations and global civil society is vital in moving \ntowards more just and friendly relations among nations. \n Our efforts to address new challenges must be \nfollowed up by redoubling our commitment to resolve \n  \n \n09-52604 40 \n \nremaining historical conflicts, chief among which is \nthe conflict in the Middle East. Afghanistan reiterates \nits call for the full implementation of United Nations \nresolutions and regional initiatives for bringing an end \nto the suffering of the Palestinian nation and creating a \nsafe region for all Middle Eastern nations. \n On the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the \nestablishment of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, the Islamic world faces a number of \nimportant internal and external questions and issues. \nAddressing those issues and reviving the prominent \nrole of Muslims in contributing to the progress of \nhumanity and civilization can be achieved only if we, \nmembers of the Islamic world, collectively confront \nthe current intellectual stagnation that many of us \nsuffer from. As was the case during the golden era of \nIslamic history, intellectual freedom and creativity \nmust be elevated to our highest social and political \npriorities. The Islamic world is in urgent need of an \nintellectual renaissance. Islamophobia and associating \nMuslims with a violent minority are additional issues \nthat call all of us, particularly Western nations, to seek \neffective ways to confront them.  \n Let me now turn to the situation of my country, \nAfghanistan. Unfortunately, negative coverage of the \nsituation by international media has overshadowed the \nmany positive trends and developments since the \ncollapse of the Taliban regime in 2001. Alongside our \nchallenges, a new Afghanistan is emerging. That \nAfghanistan includes an emerging democracy, \nascendant State institutions, a nascent civil society, a \ngrowing private sector and strong international \nsolidarity. \n I can refer to many examples of how that new \nAfghanistan is advancing. In the fields of education, \nhealth, infrastructure, media and economic growth, the \ngenerous support and sacrifices of the international \ncommunity have been vital in our joint and proud \nachievements in Afghanistan, for which we Afghans \nremain grateful. \n The Afghanistan presidential and provincial \nelections in August demonstrated the many positive \nchanges. It was the first time in the modern history of \nAfghanistan that Afghan institutions were tasked with \norganizing and holding a nationwide election. Taking \ninto account the socio-historic realities of Afghanistan, \nwe passed that national test successfully. In addition to \nit being our first experience, we were faced with \ndangerous enemies who did their utmost to disrupt and \nderail the process by terrorizing Afghan voters. By \nbraving Al-Qaida, the Taliban and other terrorist \ngroups, Afghan voters demonstrated their determination \nand desire to have a modern, moderate and democratic \npolitical system. \n As in any emerging democracy, undoubtedly \nthere were irregularities. But one should not assess a \nyoung, terrorist-inflicted democracy with the criteria \nused for old, stable and prosperous democracies. In \npassing judgement we should be conscious of the \ncontext, the process and the full picture, rather than of \nonly one aspect or issue. \n In due course, the Independent Election \nCommission and the Electoral Complaints Commission \nwill announce and certify the final results of the \nelections. For the sake of the stability and \nconsolidation of our young democratic institutions and \nprocesses, it is imperative that all of us respect and \nsupport their decision. Continuing efforts to \ndelegitimize and undermine the integrity of the process \nand our institutions will certainly result in worsening \nthe situation not only for Afghanistan but also for the \ninternational community. \n Afghanistan still faces significant challenges. \nChief among them is terrorism, which enjoys safe \nhavens and institutional support beyond our borders. \nAs long as terrorist infrastructure, including the \nTaliban leadership, and sanctuaries remain protected, \nAfghanistan, the region and the world will be at the \nmercy of terrorists and their totalitarian ideology and \nobjectives. Only by pursuing a comprehensive strategy \nwith adequate resources, effective implementation and, \nmore importantly, strategic patience, can we address \nour interconnected challenges. The main pillars of such \na comprehensive strategy are security, good \ngovernance, economic development, regional \ncooperation and international solidarity. \n Afghanistan fully endorses President Obama\u2019s \nnew strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan and the new \nassessment by General McChrystal, in particular their \nemphasis on the need for a comprehensive and \nlong-term strategy. The forthcoming international \nconference on Afghanistan will be an opportunity for \nus to review and reiterate our mutual commitment and \ndetermination to address Afghanistan\u2019s remaining \nchallenges. We must renew the sense of partnership \n \n \n41 09-52604 \n \nand cooperation between Afghanistan and the \ninternational community.  \n The principles of good governance, mutual \naccountability and regional cooperation are of the \nhighest priority. There must be a zero tolerance for any \ndrug-related activity or corruption by the Afghan \nGovernment or our international partners. \n What the Afghan nation expects and deserves \nfrom a renewed partnership with the international \ncommunity is assurance of a long-term commitment \nand solidarity. Afghans are rightly fearful of being \nabandoned once again to lawlessness, extremism and \nexternal interference.

{"text": "\ufeff\n\nMr. President, allow me to congratulate Your Excellency on your election. Your experience assures us that you will lead our work along a firm and constructive path. I extend my congratulations to your illustrious predecessor.\nMay I once again express the appreciation of Brazil for the Secretary-General Mr. Perez de Cuellar. At the outset of this statement I wish to pay a tribute to and express my respect for the people of Colombia and for President Virgilio Barco for giving the world an example of civic courage and patient heroism, governing as he is a region fraught with turmoil, where lawlessness and fanaticism combine to destroy the country in the hallucinating anti-life of drugs.\nIn 1985, soon after taking office, I stood at this podium. Brazil was then emerging from a long night. It was recovering from tragedy and facing great uncertainties. On the international scene discord prevailed. Four years later I see a different political landscape: conflicts have been reduced and dialogue resumed. There is hope. The war between Iran and Iraq has come to an end. Foreign troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan. Positive developments have taken Place in Central America and southern Africa. Namibia is well on the way to independence. There are genuine prospects for internal reconciliation and understanding in Angola. Direct contact has been resumed between Argentina and the United Kingdom. The interests of peace, security and development have been reinforced in the South Atlantic. The two super-Powers have come to agreement on the actual reduction of nuclear arsenals.\nBut we are still far from a world free from anguish, tension and fear. There still remain problems clamouring for solution. In the Middle East the fury of fanaticism continues to claim the lives of innocent peoples and to tear asunder States such as Lebanon, which was once exemplary for its balance between different religious groups, m South Africa the apartheid regime still persists, an affront to the conscience of civilized peoples, in certain areas, to a greater or lesser degree, human rights are being disregarded. In East Timor appeals go unheeded.\n\nBut the spirit of peace has made progress as the supreme value of coexistence among nations. Other great values of modern man - democracy and human rights - have gained strength. As we look back over these last four years there is one thing of which we can be certain: degradation is moving ahead in the\ncontemporary world. The establishment or re-establishment of free institutions is a universal aspiration.\nThe march is on to reinstate or establish democratic freedoms. From my own Painful  experience I bear witness to the struggle in the transition to It has the significance of life and a bitter fight, mitigated by the fascination of Playing , part in great changes. My term of office will soon come to an end. What can offer as an end result is to have achieved in five years 50 years of progress towards democracy. We are enjoying a period of unprecedented freedom. Our institutions have been restored and a State based on the rule of law has been established. We have built a truly democratic society, with a high degree of organization and participation, in an open system which enables the people to express their will. We are the third largest democracy in the world, with 82 million voters. We held elections in 1985 and 1986. In 1987 we convened a National Constituent Assembly. We drafted a new Constitution. We held elections in 1988, and on 15 November this year we will elect my successor. All this is taking place in a peaceful and orderly climate, always harmonizing the exuberance of aspirations that have at last been freed. We have had to contend with 10,000 strikes, they were settled in a spirit of conciliation. We have been operating within an economic crisis. \n\nIt is not only through Brazil that the winds of freedom have swept. In South America, that vast new world, there will not be a single country which is not under democratic rule by the end of the year. authoritarianism has been definitely discredited.  \nThe greatest wave of democratisation the world has known since the end of the war has swept through Latin America. A burning question, however haunts the conscience of our people: will the democratic values that we built be capable of dealing with the problems of suffering, misery, poverty, inequality, exploitation and violence that are part of our daily lives? Are the democracies of the wealthy countries joining us in solidarity with our cause, or are they concerned only with their own well-being, relegating us to marginal existence? \nI am convinced that democracy is the road to follow. It was the banner that led our people to sweep away authoritarian regimes, strongmen, tyrants and dictators. But it did not do so merely to replace them with hunger, disease, backwardness, foreign debt, recession and unemployment. \nLatin America shows signs of negative growth. It is not that we have grown less than other countries: it is simply that we have moved backwards. Suffice it to say that in 1988 the region's gross domestic product was at the same level as in 1978. The net transfer of resources abroad in 1988 amounted to $29 billion. Brazil alone, in the past five years, transferred approximately $56 billion abroad. This is Marshall plan in reverse. \nThe greatest wave of degradation the world has seen since the end of the second world war has swept through Latin America. A burning question. however, haunts the conscience of our peoples, are the democratic values that we have built be capable of dealing with the problems of suffering, misery, poverty, inequality, and violence that are part of our everyday life. Are the democracies the wealthy countries coming in solidarity with us or are they concerned only about their well-being relegating us to a marginal existence?\nI am convinced that democracy is the road to follow. It is the banner through which our peoples to sweep away authoritarian regimes, strongmen, tyrants and dictators, ant it did not do so merely to replace them with hunger, disease.\nbackwardness, foreign debt, recession and unemployment. Latin America shows signs of negative growth, it means that it has grown less than other continents and that we simply we have moved backwards.\nThe 1980s have seen a sustained expansion of the industrialized economies. It was to be expected that this expansion would stimulate economic growth in the developing countries. Nevertheless, the rise in international interest rates for reasons beyond our control, the drastic reduction in the prices of raw materials, commercial protectionism, the volatility of exchange rates, the globalisation of financial markets, and the net capital outflows have been responsible for the frustration of that expectation.\nThe United Nations planned in its development strategy for the 1980s that the gap between the rich and the poor would be reduced. But what happened? The number of least developed countries increased from 30 to 42.\nOnce again I ask: if the democracy we have established throughout our continent fails to meet the legitimate aspirations of our societies, how can we prevent its values from being challenged? It will serve no purpose to invoke the imperfect realization of such values.\nThe greatest enemies of democracy on our continent have been low standards of living and inflation, which corrode our economies. Lacking in resources and oppressed by a perverse international economic situation, the leaders of Latin America have no means available to meet the most legitimate and fundamental\naspirations of their societies. Guerrilla movements are proliferating in several countries. Spontaneous manifestations of revolt are springing up. Violence is building up and pent-up forces of rebellion may at any time emerge and spread uncontrollably.\nWe are no longer dealing with ideological motivations. What is at stake in Latin America is no longer the dichotomy between the capitalist and the socialist systems. In Latin America, the persistence of poverty and the worn-out models of development make ideologies outdated. This climate does not seem to be inspired by any doctrines or fed by revolutionary designs. It is a rebellion growing out of  the lack of prospects and the frustration of the deprived and disenchanted masses. Its origins are lost in remote historical times. The choice today is not between militarism and populism, but between recession and growth.\nA great many things are being said about the interdependence of today's world. For Latin America, however, interdependence has shown only its negative side, interdependence is invoked when we are confronted with the perpetuation of an international order that in reality relegates us to a dependency in which the Poorest are paradoxically coined to finance the richest and in which transfers of knowledge take place only on a horizontal plane. That is certainly not the kind of interdependence to which we aspire.\n\nThe European Common Market needed the shock of war in order to materialize. In our case, we are determined to take advantage of the shock of democracy in order to advance towards Bolivar's dream of long ago: the building of Latin American political brotherhood, Latin America, the victim of violent colonial greed, has become the most genuine melting-pot of races and cultures, extending on an unprecedented scale the miscegenation of ethnic groups and the blending of religions and customs. For Brazil, the fate of our neighbours is our own fate.\nFor us in Latin America and the Caribbean, the option for social progress is an ethical and economic imperative. We cannot continue to waste enormous Quantities of human talent because they are denied access to nourishment and education. According to the United Nations Children's Fund, there are in the world today 145 million abandoned minors between the ages of 12 and 16, and perhaps 100 million of that number live in the streets, tempted into larceny, prostitution, drugs and mugging.\nNeed we point out that these starving and unprotected adolescents in the third world are the present-day version of the poverty-stricken youth we encounter in the most biting pages of Dickens, Victor Hugo or Dostoevski?\nThere is an urgent need to create conditions through which the developing countries can return to their natural status as recipients of capital, reversing as quickly as possible the trend that has made them exporters of financial resources under the cruel burden of foreign debt.\nThe discipline and co-operation established by the international monetary and commercial institutions set up in the post-war period have given way to the dominance of the powerful countries' national autonomy in the formulation of their macroeconomic policies. Severe imbalances and asymmetries have developed. The impoverished situation of the developing economies have grown worse. Brazil, for example, is paying more to those institutions than it receives from them.\nAnother major problem is the trend towards an oligopoly of knowledge. Human knowledge is a cumulative process, anywhere, any time. Knowledge is universal. To restrain its potential for changing the well-being of the world, thereby restricting it to the domain of trade, of economic advantage, of cultural colonization, is to reduce mankind to material objectives that deny man himself. Science and technology, today or tomorrow, must be placed at the service of everyone, not only of a few nations.\nYet another disturbing development is the exploitation of the vulnerability imposed upon us by our foreign debt. The developing countries are being pressured to conform to a model of adjustment which is not often followed by the industrialized countries. Budgets are being balanced at enormous social cost and at the price of State bankruptcy, wages are being depressed below subsistence levels, scant attention is being paid to the legitimate aspirations of infant industries and to balance-of-payments requirements, the public sector has kindled even in those areas in which the need for action is greatest, such as education and health. No attention is being paid to the fact that the primary need of the debtor countries is to grow and that only through accelerated growth can they introduce the necessary economic reforms. fulfil their commitments and contribute, as they have in the past, to global progress.\nThere is an urgent need to understand that growth is impossible when about one third of domestic savings is exported to foreign countries every year. It will be impossible to make any adjust as long as we are required to solve an insoluble equation. It is time to recognize that up to now the remedy for the problem of foreign debt has contributed chiefly to the financial health of the creditors. For the debtors it has been a prescription for stagnation and impoverishment. I repeat: the time has come to adopt a strategy based on the assumption of renewed growth in the debtor countries. Such a strategy will require a sharp reduction in the stock of the debt and in the gross and net transfers of resources abroad, the only way to retain the savings necessary to finance development.\nWe view with deep concern the slow pace and the indifference with which this problem is being handled and the way its solution is being postponed.\nThere are two major questions to which we must also give our priority attentions environmental protection and the fight against drug traffic and drug abuse. These subjects wi11 figure more and more prominently on our global agenda.\nThe first question relates to the survival of mankind, to the death of life on this planet. The second relates to a life of death, to anti-life, to the destruction of the human person, chiefly in its purest form: youth.\nIn the question of the environment we have another dimension of the interdependence of nations. As inhabitants of the same small planet, we are all condemned to solidarity.\nThe environmental question in its planetary aspects - climate change, depletion of the ozone layer - cannot and must not be discussed from a narrow Perspective, as if it were a problem between North and South in which the less developed countries, by their irresponsible behaviour, were affecting the ecological balance of the world.\nThe truth is quite different. The industrialized countries bear the greatest responsibility for the pollution of the environment. The developing countries cannot accept as a basis for a new mode of international relations a concept of environmentally sustainable development which assigns to them only the task of ensuring the ecological balance of the planet, if this concept is to be valid, it will be essential to extend it to the industrialized countries so as to make it possible to determine whether the production and consumption patterns they follow can be sustained from the environmental point of view, it will be essential to establish close co-operation among all countries in efforts aimed at the research and development of new technologies that will be more efficient in the utilization of natural resources and will cause less pollution of the environment, moreover, firm commitments for the transfer of technology at cost will have to be established. The importance we attach to the problem of the environment and the Brazilian readiness to deal with it objectively and openly are clearly reflected in our readiness to host the United Nations conference on environment and development in 1992.\nBrazil is more keenly aware than any other country of its exuberant, rich and extraordinary natural world, its forests, its fauna and flora. We will not give up our right to preserve this rich heritage. We preserved it in the past, when the large colonizing companies formed in the rich countries invaded the wild areas of Africa, Asia and America, brutally despoiling them. Brazil rejected them. It forbade them to enter. During the 1960s, the Hudson Institute conceived the idea of a vast lake which would flood Amazonia. Brazil rejected the idea. If the world today is able to turn its attention towards Amazonia, it is only because Brazilians were able to preserve it up to the present day and will continue to preserve it for the future. We are prepared, as we have always been, for cooperation. But we will never be prepared to accept restrictions upon our sovereignty.\nWith the programme known as \"Our Nature\", we have already been able in a single yea, to reduce the fire-clearing of forests by about 40 per cent, we have banned the export of timber, we have eliminated the incentives for projects which have proved to be predatory, and we have created the Institute of the Environment, in which dozens of organizations have joined in a broad project for ecological Protection. Approximately 8 million hectares of Brazilian territory are now subject to a regime of permanent conservation. Approximately 10 per cent of the national territory is reserved for the total indigenous population of 200,000. At the same time, Brazil is viewing with great concern the problem of drug trafficking and illicit drug production and consumption. We took an important step forward in 1988 with the adoption of the Vienna Convention. The constantly growing dimensions of the problem make it urgent for the United Nations General Assembly to turn its attention to the adoption of effective measures of cooperation.\nBrazil will make every effort to contribute, along with the consumer, producer and transit countries, to the eradication once and for all of this serious threat to our societies, we are pursuing a vigorous preventive policy in this field. With our -Northern Basin\" programme in the Amazon, we have been occupying and patrolling our extensive frontiers in order to help the local population and to prevent the entry of drug traffickers escaping from other countries. We are maintaining control over the trade in precursors. We are waging, unremittingly, a war on drugs. The picture I have painted leads us to contemplate the qualitative transformation of our world.\nThe ideological confrontation which has governed international events throughout this century is showing clear signs of abating. Irreconcilable opposition is being replaced by understanding. Ideologies are losing-their emotional content as the advances of science and technology disclose growing prospects for human well-being. It would be Utopian to imagine a world totally free from conflict, but I do not think it nonsensical to think of a rational world in which co-operation and understanding replace confrontation and dish money, a world in which it will finally be possible to build peace on the solid basis of a universal community of interests, a world in which the democratisation of international relations will lead to the overcoming of power politics.\nThe fundamental difference between the United Nations and its predecessor, the League of Nations, is precisely the awareness of the right to development. That is the ideal that constantly inspires the Economic and Social Council and the Organization as a whole. The League of Nations sought to establish international order, which was no small task, but the United Nations aspires to something more: it seeks also international justice.\nHenry Adams declared that so-called practical politics consists in ignoring facts. I am afraid that comment is applicable to the mentality currently prevailing. We need the boldness to advance new concepts, the pioneering spirit to develop new approaches, the courage to carry out new institutional experiments. Let us hope that the decade of the 1990s and the United Nations will be able to think about the problems assailing mankind on the eve of the year 2000.\nOur century has not grown old in vain. There are some who attempt to characterize it as an end of history. According to them, the world - and the rich world in particular - is destined to live through a long period of historical inertia made up of prosaic pleasures and mediocre satisfactions. The price of eliminating violence would apparently be cultural lethargy and the political laziness of an age without convulsions but also without ideals. That view amounts to a denial of human experience.  New countries such as our have the feeling of standing on the threshold of an age of great changes. The historical process is now in full bloom. We envisage a mankind free from antagonisms, threats and fear, opening up frontiers for a new kind of man who can achieve the goal of creation, conceived in the image of God. \nTwo years ago, Brazil had the honour to be elected by this assembly, after almost two decades of absence, to membership of the Security Council. These have been for us two years of intensive participation in the Council's work. That experience prompts some reflections. If the United Nations, acting through the Security Council, is to be able to perform the prominent role expected of it in the field of international peace and security, some changes must be made in the structure and procedures of the Council itself. How can we solve important problems relating, for example, to the establishment and financing of peace-keeping operations without re-examining the very adequacy of the composition of the Council?\nThat is a problem that deserves to be examined not only from the traditional standpoint of establishing a proper relationship between the number of non-permanent members and the increase that has taken place in the number of states members of the UN, but also - and especially - in the light of the changes in power relationships that have taken place since the organisation was created. The time has come for changes. We would consider an additional category of permanent members that would not have the veto privilege. \nNew circumstances on the intentional scene - in particular the easing of Political and ideological confrontation - unquestionably open up possibilities for  a more efficient utilization of the United Nations. But that must not mean a return, pure and simple, to an excessive predominance of the super-Powers over the Organization. The United Nations certainly cannot do without consensus between the super-Powers as the basis for effective action. In many cases, however, that consensus will not be enough. Contributions by other Member States may be necessary, and even indispensable, if the Organization is to be able to act effectively and responsibly as a truly international institution.\nThe time has come to make development and justice the foundations of world peace and stability. This Organization was created as the result of the struggle against totalitarianism, and represents the most advanced level of achievement in terms of democratic relations among States. We must therefore take advantage of the opportunities afforded by ideological demobilization in order to dedicate ourselves with renewed vigour to the great causes of international co-operation, we must dare. -Dare if you dare,- said the Portuguese poet Pernando Peszoa. I propose that the united Nations commit itself to a process of broad and total dialogue on the major problems of these closing years of the century in order that we may enter the twenty-first century with an awareness of the challenges that face us and of our potential. Prom disarmament to the environment, from the banning of chemical weapons to the transfer of technology, from democracy as an instrument of stability and development to civil rights and political freedoms, from economic reforms to international trade, from the regionalization of the world economy to the new faces of interdependence, from the conquest of outer space to the eradication of poverty, we are faced with challenges that invite discussion. We must go to the source of our problems, understand them in all their complexity, face their consequences without vacillation, take the necessary decisions and eliminate the factors of de-stabilization and inequality.\nLet us act before it is too late, before sacrifices and frustrations crystallize into rebellion, before the satisfied people of the world in their complacency become insensitive to the just demands of those who have little or nothing, before room for negotiation is reduced by mutual fear and intransigent confrontation.\nNo country or group of countries, no matter how powerful, can claim to be in a position to solve the crisis alone, with an open mind, without mental reservations, resentments or ulterior motives, let us set to work, perhaps there will never again be a moment in history in which ideological demobilization will offer such favourable conditions. Let us be capable of transforming reality through the creative power of ideas. We call upon everyone, and especially the more powerful, to join in that task. It is not too late to salvage the dream of peace and justice dreamt by past generations.\nAt the opening of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly, I wish to leave members with a message of optimism and determination, the same message which inspires Brazilians, who have taken a hand in their own destiny through the democracy they have succeeded in building.\nIt is Brazil's strength of belief that has enabled it to consolidate a new democracy in our America, triumphing over many challenges. It. is For the same reason that Brazilians express their views here, through the voice of their President, to dream the dream of peace and justice, exorcizing fear and raising altars to hope.\nAs a politician and an intellectual, I have never regarded poetry as an uninvited guest at the assembly's plenary meetings. It is with poetry that I take my leave, with the verses of Luiz de Camones, the universal poet of the Portuguese language: \n\"After the storm, tempestuous and drear,\nAnd shadow of night and shrieking winds that blow\nComes on the morning hour, serene and clear,\nWith hope of harbouring safely from the woe.\"\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "BRA_44_1989", "year": 1989}, "spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 280, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 50, "token_end": 51}, {"start": 429, "end": 437, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 82, "token_end": 83}, {"start": 755, "end": 761, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 144, "token_end": 145}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1049, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 195, "token_end": 196}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1058, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 197, "token_end": 198}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1125, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 209, "token_end": 210}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1213, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 223, "token_end": 224}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1333, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 242, "token_end": 243}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1384, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 250, "token_end": 251}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1407, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 252, "token_end": 255}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1500, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 269, "token_end": 271}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1848, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 337, "token_end": 338}, {"start": 1929, "end": 1941, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 352, "token_end": 354}, {"start": 3865, "end": 3871, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 725, "token_end": 726}, {"start": 3913, "end": 3926, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 735, "token_end": 737}, {"start": 5238, "end": 5244, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 992, "token_end": 993}, {"start": 9509, "end": 9515, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1761, "token_end": 1762}, {"start": 10936, "end": 10942, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2017, "token_end": 2018}, {"start": 15365, "end": 15374, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2827, "token_end": 2828}, {"start": 15541, "end": 15547, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2856, "token_end": 2857}, {"start": 15916, "end": 15922, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2928, "token_end": 2929}, {"start": 16065, "end": 16071, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2957, "token_end": 2958}, {"start": 16177, "end": 16187, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2979, "token_end": 2980}, {"start": 16863, "end": 16872, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3113, "token_end": 3114}, {"start": 17068, "end": 17074, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3148, "token_end": 3149}, {"start": 17448, "end": 17454, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3212, "token_end": 3213}, {"start": 17706, "end": 17711, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3259, "token_end": 3260}, {"start": 18453, "end": 18460, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3385, "token_end": 3386}, {"start": 20615, "end": 20621, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3787, "token_end": 3788}, {"start": 23051, "end": 23061, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4221, "token_end": 4222}, {"start": 25111, "end": 25121, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4595, "token_end": 4596}, {"start": 25313, "end": 25320, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4634, "token_end": 4635}, {"start": 25730, "end": 25734, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4717, "token_end": 4718}, {"start": 25773, "end": 25783, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4726, "token_end": 4727}]}
