{"text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, I am very pleased to see such a distinguished son of Africa receive the honour of presiding over the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The bonds between our two countries, Nigeria end Barbados, are of long standing, rooted in a common past, enriched by \u0430 common drive to uplift our peoples and un weakened by the distance that separates us. We know intimately of your personal skill and flair in diplomacy. I unhesitatingly pledge the full co-operation of my delegation during your tenure.\nMay I also take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, for his skilful chairmanship and guidance throughout the forty-third session.\nSince the birth of the Organization some 45 years ago the world has made considerable progress. The age of high technology is with us. Many countries of the industrialized world have achieved high standards of living and substantial material advancement for their people. After more than three almost-uninterrupted decades of direct and indirect confrontation, the leading nuclear Powers have begun to beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into priming-hooks. With that development has followed an apparent weariness with conflict-by-proxy across the far readies of the globe There seems to be a genuine universal desire to participate in the search for peace.\nIt is, however, incumbent upon the super-Powers to ensure that this new dimension in their relations is no passing phenomenon, no short respite while arsenals are refurbished and economies restructured. It is our hope that the developments of the past two years are the basis for lasting global peace. \nStar the peoples of the non-industrialized countries these trends present a unique opportunity for us to pursue our development free from the encumbrances of ideological conflict. We must remain vigilant however, and be determined that we never again become unwitting pawns in the deadly games of the not-too-distant past should there be a retreat into the old ways of super-Power rivalry. We must be ever vigilant, because many of the major problems that confront us today have no ideological solutions in the interdependent world in which we live.\nAnd yet, in spite of the considerable progress the world has made, there remains a stubborn residue of problems that are as intractable today as they were half a century ago. For a large number of the world's population so little has changed in past decades that their development objectives, however modified, remain basically the same  For them, their economic and social problems are still their most urgent problems, and none of us can possibly say they are within sight of solution. There is still far too much degrading poverty on the face of the Earth. There are large inequalities in wealth within nations and between rich and poor nations. There are glaring gaps and disparities in the provision of housing, health and education for a substantial part of the world's population. There is the soul-destroying sickness of apartheid in South Africa and the lingering disease of racial intolerance and prejudice in many countries of the world. There are discord and conflict in the Middle East and smouldering embers of strife in South East Asia.\nThere ought to be no question that the struggle for economic advancement and social development of the non-industrialised nations of the world should be one of the urgent and consuming priorities of international life today.\nThe current international problems of debt, protectionism, the net reverse flew of financial resources, global warming, threats to the Earth's ozone layer, creeping deserts, pollution and other forms of environmental degradation, destruction wrought by hurricanes and other natural disasters, ANDS, drug abuse and the illegal traffic in drugs - all compound the plight of the peoples of the developing world.\nI take this opportunity to express Barbados' sympathy with the countries that were recently ravaged by hurricane Hugo, particularly our sister countries in the Caribbean, and to urge the international community to co-ordinate and provide material support to the countries in need as a matter of urgency. I trust that these experiences will serve as an impetus to the international community to give its full support to the proclamation of the international decade for natural disasters.\nOur responses to the challenges presented by the countless problems I have mentioned will be a test of the resilience of the multilateral system. Just as national development demands nothing less than the transformation of a society and its economy, so too in an interdependent world will economic and social development necessitate the transformation of attitudes in the international community and the transformation of the international economy. It is clear that the prescription calls for joint, co-operative and consensual action and responsibility if lasting solutions are to be found, solutions that do not themselves create more critical problems.\nThe foremost lesson to be learned in adherence to the principle of multilateralism is the danger of believing that any single country or group of countries can alone command the way forward or has exclusive insights into the way our relations on this planet should be shaped. Our history is replete with examples that reveal that that attitude o\u00a3 mind has prevailed in the past, needless to say with disastrous consequences. In the final analysis everyone is searching for the way forward; from the smallest to the biggest, from the weakest to the strongest, everyone has a contribution to make in this process. \nFor small developing countries like Barbados there is really no alternative to the multilateral process. We have no capacity to project military might beyond our shores. We command no great influence in the total scheme of international economic relations. But we have one means of making our voice heard at the global level that is through our contribution to the multilateral process and our appeal to fairness and equity in international relations.\nWe therefore urge the nations of the world to return to true multilateralism as the only effective way to meet the challenges of promoting and ensuring what has been described as self-sustaining, international economic growth and development t and a restructured economic system of co-operation. In relation to international debt, the record of action so far emphasizes the need for a global conference to look at the question of debt in all its dimensions. The ad hoc end piecemeal measures which have been put forward so far are clearly not addressing the problem in the timely and comprehensive manner that is necessary, failure to involve all parties, including particularly the private commercial banks, has produced obstacles to the full implementation of the various proposals, resulting in half-hearted efforts at implementation and less than full coverage of those affected.\nIn addition, the emergence of new centres of economic power and the prospect of new patterns of trade and investment make such a conference even more vital. Any further delay in holding the conference will only increase the already intolerable social costs being borne by indebted countries as they strive to repay their debts. It is certain that the terrible effects in terms of social upheaval and dislocation will be fait far beyond the confines of the national borders within which they occur.\nIn relation to the environment, it is heartening that there has been a fairly quick decision on a global approach to the problem. The General Assembly will have to work hard at this session to ensure that the preparations for the 1992 conference on environment and development are placed on a sure foundation. Even at this stage, however, some ideas can be offered about what Barbados would like to see emerge at, and from, the conference.\nBarbados hopes that, as a minimum, some concrete measures will be agreed upon to enable developing countries to contribute more fully to the efforts to protect the global environment. We recognize that sacrifices will have to be made by all countries, but it is only equitable that the developed countries, which are in a better position to do so and which have contributed significantly to the present environmental problems, bear proportionately a larger portion of the burden.  Above all, arrangements to protect and preserve the environment must ensure that the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries to create a better life for their people secured.\nI am happy to report that Barbados and its sister States members of the Caribbean Community have recently taken steps to create mechanisms at the regional level for ongoing consultation and co-operation on environmental matters which are of paramount interest to us all.\nIn relation to illegal narcotic drugs, it is clear that efforts to eliminate this menace will be doomed to failure unless they reflect the will of producer, consumer and transit States alike. So far, activity has been concentrated on efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs to consuming countries.\nEfforts, however, to reduce and eliminate the demand for illegal drugs have be   not nearly as concerted and, as a result, not as effective. It has become evident that catchy slogans, although they serve to focus attention on the issue, are not sufficient. It will be necessary to direct much more effort and resources towards education to spread the message of the dangers of narcotic drugs for it is only when the demand of consumers is reduced that the core of the problem will have been reached. Equal emphasis will need to be placed on rehabilitation programmes to reclaim those who have become the victims of drug abuse. These measures are essential if the long-term dimensions of the drug problem are to be addressed.\nBarbados' concern with the dangers of illegal drugs has been all the more heightened because our principal resource is our people. Barbados lacks large deposits of minerals, vast rivers and forests. It has been through the ingenuity of our people that some measure of progress may be seen in our development efforts. Our women in particular have played a significant and leading role in these development efforts. Thus, any factor which reduces the capacity of our people to fulfil the tasks of development is an attack on the very foundations of our existence as a nation. My country is in the process of adopting comprehensive measures aimed at effectively combating and halting the illegal traffic in drugs in Barbados. However, the efforts of individual countries need to be buttressed, and we commend regional and multilateral efforts.\nIn this regard, I wish to pledge the support of Barbados for the courageous and resolute efforts of President Virgilio Barco and the Government and people of Colombia to free their country from the grip of narco-terror. We support, too, the initiatives presented by the Governments of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica aimed at excising the cancer of illicit trade in drugs and we urge the international community to join in this support.\nThe scourge of ANDS, like drug abuse and drug trafficking, respects no borders. It is vital that in the fight against ANDS the international community deploy all the resources at its command. Above all, it is imperative that developments in science and technology be made available to all countries if the universal battle against ANDS is to be waged successfully. The choice is clean we unite- or perish.\nDeveloping countries like Barbados are engaged in an interminable struggle to ensure that we are not left behind in the evolution of the global economy. There is an unfortunate trend for developed countries increasingly to coordinate their policies in key economic sectors without involving a range of the developing nations which will ultimately be affected by those policies. Barbados fully supports the efforts at consultation among those with the greatest capacity to effect change in the international economy. We feel, however, that such co-ordination should more fully take into account and reflect the views and concerns of those with the greatest needs.\nCertain factors should govern the transformation of the global economy. Foremost among these is the unequal capacities of developing and developed countries to make the necessary adaptations. The developed countries are better able by far to adjust to the new realities; indeed they are helping to create the momentum for change. It is vital, therefore, that the developing countries be helped to make the necessary adjustments; for it is only if the transformation of the developing countries corresponds to that of the developed world that a true balance can be attained which favours the majority over minority interests.\nThis year we witness the celebration of the emergence and triumph of democracy in at least three countries. The Republic of Costa Rica will shortly mark the 100th anniversary of its democracy. The Republic of Prance has celebrated the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. We congratulate those countries. My own country, Barbados, is commemorating 350 years of Parliament. Our experience of 350 years of parliamentary government has taught us the power which resides in the hands of the people. Prom a narrowly constituted body reflecting the interests of a minority of colonists, the Barbados Parliament has been transformed into a truly representative institution in which the concerns of all Barbadians may be pursued. It is against this background that Barbadians can empathize with the aspirations of people throughout the world to become masters of their destiny, through freely and democratically elected representatives.\nThis aspiration has burned strong in the breasts of the oppressed people of southern Africa. Change is on the horizon for Namibia after years of domination by the apartheid regime of South Africa. Barbados's long-standing commitment to this process of change is underscored by the deployment of a contingent of 21 Barbadian police officers in Namibia within the framework of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNIAG)  But the international community must remain vigilant lest  at the eleventh hour, the evil regime of apartheid conspires to snatch the prize of freedom from the grasp of the Namibian people. Certain ominous developments in Namibia only serve to warn of that possibility. It is therefore vitally important that the apartheid regime be told in no uncertain terms, especially by those to whom it must listen, that the international community will not be satisfied with anything less than freedom for the Namibian people.\nHe must be conscious, however, that the achievement of political freedom is only the starting-point for Namibia's membership of the community of nations. Considerable financial and technical assistance will be necessary to place the country on the path to economic development. My country has in its small way tried to further this cause through regular contributions to the various funds for Namibia and the provision of educational scholarships for Namibians in Barbados. Barbados stands ready to continue and intensify the assistance which it has been giving to Namibians and urges all members of the international community to do likewise within their respective capabilities. He will have failed in our several responsibilities if we merely assist in Namibia's emergence as an independent nation under the shadow of apartheid's economic domination.\nThe international community equally cannot relax until the stain of' apartheid is eradicated from South Africa and truly representative government is introduced in benighted land. He must not be fooled by the merely cosmetic changes which have been made in South Africa through the staging of totally undemocratic elections. That is merely an attempt to give apartheid a respectable face and prolong its existence as well as an attempt to lull the international community into inaction on the eradication of apartheid. But none of us, none of the nations which proclaim support for fundamental and inalienable human rights, the essential principles of justice and equality and the virtues of a democratic form of government can be satisfied until that odious system f apartheid is completely eliminated. For while the situation in South Africa lingers it remains an obstacle to world peace.\nThe hunger for peace is evident in the decision reached by the five Presidents of Central America at their meeting in August in Tela# Honduras. Barbados has long supported the principle of applying regional solutions to regional problems. We have on several occasions and in various forums reaffirmed out support for, and commitment to  the peace initiatives launched by the Contadora Group. We pledge our support for the peace process, which has now been given a renewed impetus, and call upon all States to do likewise.\nIt is unfortunate that while it may be considered that some progress towards peace has been realized in one dimension of the Central American problem, elsewhere on the isthmus tension and strife are steadily increasing. A series of unfortunate events has dealt a serious blow to the hopes of the democratic forces in Panama. Following the abrupt suspension of the democratic process in the presidential elections held in Panama in May this year, the Prime Minister of Barbados, the Bight Honourable Erskine Sandiford, issued a statement voicing Barbados concern that any deterioration of the situation in Panama could lead to an escalation of tensions in the region with the gravest consequences for the peace and security of the hemisphere. He expressed the view that the democratic nations of the hemisphere could help to resolve the crisis in Panama by insisting that any solution must be consistent with respect for human rights and authentic democracy on the basis of fair and free elections, with the sovereign right of the Panamanian people to determine their own destiny free from external intervention, with the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties, and achieved through peaceful negotiations. Once again we urge all States to work within these parameters for the rapid and. peaceful resolution of the crisis in Panama.\nThe international community must also renew its efforts to bring peace to that long troubled region, the Middle East. Barbados believes that  \u03b9 international conference on the Middle East offers the best hope for a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Middle East question. Peace will continue to be an elusive objective until the desire of the Palestinian people for a homeland and the right of all States in the region to live within secure boundaries. He urge those in authority to fulfil the responsibilities which are theirs by virtue of their power and to move swiftly to the table of internationally sponsored negotiations and so end the deadly cycle of violent.\nBarbados agrees with the view that the United Nations system represents man\u2019s loftiest hopes for a better future. As a mechanism for solving problems the United Nations system is without parallel. It provides opportunities for a cross-fertilisation of ideas, and its Charter, notwithstanding the criticisms levelled against it, offers the most comprehensive guidelines for international action yet crafted by man.\nFor all its potential the united Nations system can do no more than the will of the Member States allows. It is therefore imperative that we fulfil our obligations to the Organisation, No longer can its operations be held to ransom through non-compliance with legal obligations regarding payment of contributions. Solemn undertakings must not be cast aside in the pursuit of national objectives. the United Nations is not to be supported when it suits narrow national interests and simply shunted aside when it does not.\nIt is clear, however, that the reform of the United Nations system must be carried forward speedily if its operations ace to be placed on a sound and secure footing for the future. In relation to United Nations peace-keeping activities it is clear that in the last two years demands on the Organization have increased considerably. As negotiated settlements are reached in one conflict area after the other, it is likely that the United Nations will be called upon to act as guarantor of the peace again and again. If the United Nations is to fulfil in the most efficient manner the demands being made upon it then some attention must be paid to enhancing its capacity in the area of peace supervision. Only in this way can we hope to avoid some of the difficulties which have been evident. In addition we must counter the forces which would see the United Nations as e mere shield, a cover for the pursuit of national interests as opposed to the interests of the world community as a whole.\nI take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have given their lives in the service of the United Nations. Humankind cannot afford to ignore the possibilities which have been afforded us for a brighter tomorrow. To do so would be to condemn ourselves to repeat the mistakes of past decades with perhaps even more severe consequences for life on this planet. Barbados is convinced that if these opportunities for peace and development are to be exploited to the fullest they must be brought fully within the ambit of the United Nations system} they must not be left to the vagaries of changing personalities and alliances, or continue to exist at the level of bilateral or only partially multilateral relations. \nOur future action must also more fully reflect a commitment to certain principles and objectives. Those that come quickly to mind include: a renewed commitment to the process of consultation, the broadening of co-ordination in the economic sector, the equitable sharing of burdens and responsibilities; the search for comprehensive, as opposed to partial, ad hoc and temporary solutions to problems; the intensification of support, for the economic recovery of developing countries; greater attention to the human dimension of development; respect for basic human rights over narrow national concerns; and the fulfilment of the aspiration of all peoples to self-determination.\nThose are not new ideas. I certainly claim no right of authorship over them. They have been around for a long time, unfortunately more often ignored than recognized. I believe the success of our efforts to bequeath a better world to succeeding generations will largely depend on our commitment to those principles.\nAs we look back on the developments that have taken place in the recent past, we have cause for hope. There is an atmosphere of optimism, albeit cautious at times, that great things are within the grasp of mankind if only we put our minds and energies to the task of achieving them. As we face the future we can draw sustenance from the belief that a new era of peace and development can be ushered in on this planet.\nThe peoples of the developing world aspire to far more them mere survival. They deserve a. nobler destiny, a concept justified by the high moral obligation to recognize the inherent equality of all human beings and to acknowledge that there is dignity in the human reason and that every living soul on the face of the Earth deserves an equal opportunity to strive, and to achieve, and to create a more just and humane world. \n", "meta": {"doc_id": "BRB_44_1989", "year": 1989}, "spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 223, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 42, "token_end": 43}, {"start": 228, "end": 236, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 44, "token_end": 45}, {"start": 3061, "end": 3073, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 567, "token_end": 569}, {"start": 7154, "end": 7157, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1278, "token_end": 1279}, {"start": 7871, "end": 7879, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1407, "token_end": 1408}, {"start": 7935, "end": 7943, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1422, "token_end": 1423}, {"start": 8628, "end": 8636, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1544, "token_end": 1545}, {"start": 9898, "end": 9906, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1780, "token_end": 1781}, {"start": 10897, "end": 10905, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1957, "token_end": 1958}, {"start": 12978, "end": 13004, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2323, "token_end": 2328}, {"start": 13063, "end": 13085, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2338, "token_end": 2342}, {"start": 13198, "end": 13206, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2361, "token_end": 2362}, {"start": 13462, "end": 13470, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2407, "token_end": 2408}, {"start": 13572, "end": 13582, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2423, "token_end": 2424}, {"start": 13928, "end": 13935, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2482, "token_end": 2483}, {"start": 13989, "end": 14001, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2492, "token_end": 2494}, {"start": 14001, "end": 14013, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2494, "token_end": 2497}, {"start": 14120, "end": 14129, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2516, "token_end": 2517}, {"start": 14149, "end": 14156, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2520, "token_end": 2521}, {"start": 14410, "end": 14418, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2566, "token_end": 2567}, {"start": 14459, "end": 14466, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2573, "token_end": 2574}, {"start": 14737, "end": 14745, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2622, "token_end": 2623}, {"start": 14858, "end": 14865, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2646, "token_end": 2647}, {"start": 15147, "end": 15154, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2694, "token_end": 2695}, {"start": 15218, "end": 15226, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2704, "token_end": 2705}, {"start": 15510, "end": 15517, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2751, "token_end": 2752}, {"start": 15706, "end": 15718, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2784, "token_end": 2786}, {"start": 15865, "end": 15877, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2811, "token_end": 2813}, {"start": 16439, "end": 16451, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2907, "token_end": 2909}, {"start": 17503, "end": 17508, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3099, "token_end": 3100}, {"start": 18051, "end": 18061, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3191, "token_end": 3192}, {"start": 18704, "end": 18715, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3304, "token_end": 3305}, {"start": 19029, "end": 19037, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3362, "token_end": 3363}]}
{"text": "\ufeff272.\tMr. President, allow me, on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country, who is unable to be present, to convey to you, over and above the traditional congratulations, the satisfaction of the delegation of the Republic of Guinea on the occasion of your unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-eighth session of our General Assembly. These congratulations are extended also to each of the members of the General Committee, who have made themselves worthy of the confidence of our august Assembly.\n273.\tI should like also to discharge a pleasant duty, namely, to pay a deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, Deputy-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic, and to tell him how greatly we appreciated the tact, courtesy and competence with which he conducted the work of the twenty-seventh session, of the General Assembly.\n274.\tYour election to the presidency of this twenty-eighth session appears to us like a definite guarantee of the lucid conduct of our work towards the adoption of decisions in favour of the liberation of peoples, towards justice and equality among all peoples, that are the necessary conditions for peace and security.\n275.\tYou are a Latin American. It is, therefore, obvious that your love of the rights of peoples cannot be questioned. Child of the third world, you are inevitably sensitive, for more than one reason, to the many ills afflicting countries that are victims of the manoeuvres of the rich States. Thanks to the enormous experience you have acquired in the course of your diplomatic career, you are perfectly aware of the problems which paralyse our Organization, thus making peace and security precarious.\n\n276.\tThe readiness of States to subscribe to the principles of mutual understanding is an important element if we are to ensure international security and durable peace on our planet. The task that devolves on us is therefore that of uniting our efforts so as to work for the advent of a world in which the negative forces of hatred and domination will yield to those of entente and fraternity among peoples.\n277.\tThe fortunate changes that have taken place in the concept of relations between States indicate that we have reached a turning point, a concrete turning point, represented by a series of treaties and agreements one of whose most tangible results is the recent decision of the General Assembly to receive into our Organization the German Democratic Republic and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. We avail ourselves of this opportunity to extend a welcome to these friendly States which, we are convinced, will make an important and valuable contribution to the cause of peace.\n278.\tThe problem of international peace and security, the defence of national sovereignties, decolonialization and the struggle against imperialism continue to be the focus of both bilateral and multilateral meetings. The dialogue between the great Powers appears to forecast the triumph of freedom, justice and equality among peoples, the essential basis for peace on our earth. The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held recently in Algiers, has shown without the slightest doubt the resolute will affirmed by 2,000 million underprivileged men to upset the scale of accepted values and to give our universe greater social balance and its people greater hope and certainty.\n279.\tUnfortunately, international peace and security have but a partial meaning for some members of our universal community. In fact, the peace of which they speak is rather that of the hateful order that they impose on other peoples, and security to them is the security of the illegitimate privileges they enjoy at the expense of other nations.\n280.\tIs it possible for a single moment to bring an era of total peace and security throughout the world without first eradicating the causes of tension that beset Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America? It is no longer a secret to anyone that the number one enemy of the order that our Organization has undertaken to create is still imperialism and all its present manifestations, such as colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, Zionism, etc.\n281.\tAs everyone is aware, the Republic of Guinea, my country, has suffered and still suffers from the effects of imperialism which, since 28 September 1958, has hounded us for the simple reason that we have chosen the path of full responsibility. Imperialism does everything to jeopardize the sovereignty of our country. To achieve its regrettable objectives, it has allied itself with Portuguese colonial fascism, the most abject colonialism. And we understand that the fascist Government of Caetano, despite his ringing defeat on 22 December 1970 by the brave and proud people of Guinea and his condemnation by the Security Council, does not cease to indulge in acts of provocation against the peaceful Guinean population.\n282.\tPortuguese military aircraft constantly violate our air space. Every time the Portuguese troops suffer severe setbacks at the hands of freedom fighters in Guinea-Bissau, they bomb our frontier villages on the fallacious pretext of reprisals or the right of hot pursuit. Mercenaries of all kinds, paid killers trained and released by Portugal, infiltrate regularly across our frontiers for purposes of aggression.\n\n283.\tIn its implacable determination to destroy the revolutionary regime that the proud people of Guinea has chosen freely for itself, Portugal and its allies intensify the training of mercenaries in the occupied Territories of the new independent State of Guinea-Bissau and in some of the neighbouring Slates, thus preparing a new armed aggression against our people. But, regardless of the means used by international imperialism, the people of Guinea, more than ever determined and united behind its great President, Ahmed Sekou Toure, will triumph, as it did .on 22 November 1970, over the forces of domination and will continue to defend its gains and to give unreserved support to the liberation movements in order to speed up the emancipation of the African fatherland and thus to contribute to ensuring the reign of international peace and security.\n284.\tI should like, moreover, to emphasize that \u2014 like all the independent States of Africa and, generally speaking, all the countries in the world \u2014 the people of Guinea aspire profoundly to peace so that they can effectively devote themselves to the exalting task of building up their country. It is for this reason that they demand of international imperialism and its allies and, in particular, some of the neighbouring States of the Republic of Guinea that they recognize this sacred and inalienable right to peace and tranquillity \u2014 indispensable factors of peaceful coexistence.\n285.\tMy delegation wishes to emphasize the ludicrousness of the claim of the Lisbon authorities that the African Territories of Angola and Mozambique are provinces and a prolongation of Portugal. In those African Territories, there still waves the flag of that country which is not linked to Africa either by geography or by culture, or less still by a common history.\n286.\tThroughout his intervention during the present session of the General Assembly the \"worthy representative\", \"the accredited spokesman of Portugal\", Mr. Patricio, was so bold, with the audacity of which he alone is capable, as to uphold theories of assimilation, such as \"the legitimacy of Portugal as an African nation\" [2138th meeting, para. 146) and many other absurdities as well.\n287.\tNo living person can accept that grotesque assertion, and, if Bissau is called Conakry 2, Lisbon, built up thanks to the wealth of Bissau, will soon be called Conakry.\n288.\tIn his confusion, Mr. Patricio attacks the socialist countries, the Scandinavian countries, OAU and how many\nmore? We must agree that the world shrinks dangerously under the paltry views of Portugal.\n289.\tIllustrating the full dimension of the imperialist- colonialist-fascist hysteria of Portugal, Mario Soares writes:\n\"... In fact, the only specific feature of Portuguese colonialism in comparison with other European colonialisms derives essentially from the financial and mental poverty of the settlers and the economic underdevelopment of the metropolitan country, which itself is a colony of the great Powers.\" \n290.\tIn fact, the decisive element of Portugal, its chemical property, is extra-Lusitanian. One need not be an expert in political affairs to realize that that unfortunate country, because of the mediocrity of its economic and military potential, stubbornly clings to its policy only because it knows it enjoys the complicity of NATO, whose member countries flout and disdain the resolutions adopted in favour of the African peoples.\n291.\tConvinced that the cause it pursues is irreparably doomed, the Government of criminal Caetano pursues a policy of systematic destruction, of Fascist genocide, against the peaceful civilian populations of Guinea-Bissau, the Cape Verde Islands, Angola and Mozambique. Is there any need to recall in this connexion the savage massacre of over 400 Africans in the village of Wiriyamu in the Mozambican province of Tete, which aroused profound indignation and the condemnation of world public opinion.\n292.\tDefeated everywhere in the field by the revolutionary forces, the regime in Lisbon resorts at present to the physical liquidation of the authentic representatives of the African peoples. As if to qualify itself in that hateful undertaking and believing it can put an end definitely to the heroic resistance of the nationalists in Guinea-Bissau, Portuguese imperialism, on 20 January 1973, in Conakry, had our comrade Amilcar Cabral, the great freedom fighter and founder and Secretary-General of PAIGC,  cowardly\n,, assassinated by mercenaries who had infiltrated into the area.\n293.\tThe courageous people of Guinea-Bissau gave to that insolent challenge the resounding and obvious reply by proclaiming victoriously on 24 September 1973 the People's Democratic Republic of Guinea-Bissau. Our delegation applauds that historic decision enthusiastically and rejoices at the fact that our Government was the first to recognize the young independent and sovereign State. The independence of Guinea-Bissau is the triumph of reason over brute force, the victory of freedom over colonialism, the prelude to a process that will infallibly lead to the liquidation of colonialism in Africa.\n294.\tIn the liberated areas of Guinea-Bissau, the people, guided by PAIGC under the enlightened leadership of its founder and No. 1 militant, Amilcar Cabral, has, in the course of 17 years of political and armed struggle, constructed a new life and now possesses a constantly evolving administrative organization, social and cultural services, a\njudicial system, a steadily developing economy and national armed forces.\n295.\tThe visit of a United Nations Special Mission to the liberated areas of Guinea-Bissau from 2 to 8 April 1972 served to confirm to the international community what has been attested to by dozens of impartial, honest observers from every continent: the self-determination of our people and the de facto existence of an efficiently functioning State structure.\n296.\tIn flagrant violation of modern international law, the Portuguese colonialists are still encroaching upon some portions of our national territory. The United Nations has repeatedly recognized the illegality of the Portuguese presence, the inalienable right of our people to freedom and sovereignty, and the legitimacy of its struggle against Portuguese colonialism.\n297.\tOn the basis of the historic resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 concerning the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council have reaffirmed the inalienable right of our people to self- determination and independence, particularly in General Assembly resolution 2918 (XXVII) of 14 November 1972 and Security Council resolution 322 (1972) of 22 November 1972. Furthermore, on the proposal of the Special Committee on decolonization, the Fourth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly at its twenty-seventh session recognized PAIGC, the liberation movement of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands, as the only and authentic representative of the people of that Territory.\n298.\tThe People's National Assembly, which is the result of PAIGC's successes in the fight against Portuguese colonialism, was constituted on the basis of the principle that power derives from the people and should serve the people. The Assembly is composed of representatives elected by universal and direct suffrage by secret ballot, being the expression of the sovereign will of the people of Guinea-Bissau.\n299.\tAt its meeting of 24 September 1973 in the Boe region, the People's National Assembly, expressing the sovereign will of the people, solemnly proclaimed the State of Guinea-Bissau. In that proclamation, the People's National Assembly declared, inter alia:\n\"The State of Guinea-Bissau is a sovereign, republican, democratic, anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist State whose primary objectives are the complete liberation of the people of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde and the forging of a union between those two territories for the purpose of building a strong African homeland dedicated to progress. The arrangements for this union will be determined, after these two territories are liberated, in accordance with the will of the people.\n\"The State of Guinea-Bissau assumes the sacred duty of taking action to expedite, by every means, the expulsion of the forces of aggression of Portuguese colonialism from that part of the territory of Guinea- Bissau which they still occupy and to intensify the struggle in the Cape Verde Islands, which form an\nintegral and inalienable part of the national territory of the people of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde.\n\"The State of Guinea-Bissau regards the strengthening of the links of solidarity and soldierly brotherhood between our people and all peoples of the Portuguese colonies as one of the fundamental principles of its foreign policy; it stands in solidarity with the peoples struggling for their freedom and independence in Africa, Asia and Latin America and with all Arab peoples fighting against zionism.\n\"The State of Guinea-Bissau is an integral part of Africa and strives for the unity of the African peoples, respecting the freedom of those peoples, their dignity and their right to political, economic, social and cultural progress.\n\"As regards international relations, the State of Guinea-Bissau wishes to maintain and develop ties of friendship, co-operation and solidarity with its neighbours \u2014 the Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Senegal \u2014 with all independent African States and with all States throughout the world which recognize its sovereignty and support the national liberation struggle of our people. These relations shall be based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect for national sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs and mutual advantage.\n\"The State of Guinea-Bissau assumes responsibility for promoting the economic advancement of the country, thereby creating the material basis for the development of culture, science and technology, with a view to the continuing improvement of the social and economic living standards of our population and with the ultimate aim of achieving a life of peace, well-being and progress for all our country's children.\n\"Having as a foundation our heroic People's National Liberation Army, the State of Guinea-Bissau will provide our national armed forces with all necessary means to accomplish the task of bringing about the complete liberation of our country, and defending the achievements of our people and the integrity of our national territory.\n\"From the historic moment of the proclamation of the State of Guinea-Bissau, authorities and organs of the Portuguese colonial State which exercise any political, military or administrative authority in our territory are illegal, and their acts are null and void. Consequently, from that moment on, the Portuguese State has no right to assume any obligations or commitments in relation to our country. All treaties, conventions, agreements, alliances and concessions involving our country which were entered into in the past by the Portuguese colonialists will be submitted to the People's National Assembly, the supreme embodiment of State power, which will proceed to review them in accordance with the interests of our peoples.\n\"The State of Guinea-Bissau affirms the principle that it is fighting against Portuguese colonialism and not against the Portuguese people, with which our people wishes to maintain a friendly and co-operative relationship.\n\"The State of Guinea-Bissau adheres to the principles of non-alignment. It supports the settlement of international disputes by negotiation and, to that effect and in accordance with the resolutions of the highest international organs, it declares its willingness to negotiate a solution which will put an end to the aggression of the Portuguese colonial Government that is illegally occupying part of our national territory and committing acts of genocide against our populations.\"\n300.\tWe are happy to see the great sympathy with which most of the delegations attending this twenty-eighth session have welcomed the proclamation of independence by Guinea-Bissau, and we address a pressing appeal to all Governments to recognize the new State and to grant it effective and unreserved support, thus enabling it shortly to occupy its rightful place in the international community and in the specialized agencies of the United Nations.\n301.\tDespite the strong reaction of independent Africa, supported by its friends, against the appropriation by certain imperialist Powers of the enormous natural resources of the Territories under Portuguese domination, the Cabora Bassa and Cunene projects continue to receive Western capital which the criminal protagonists describe fallaciously as beneficial investments.\n302.\tMy delegation believes that we must draw other conclusions from the recognition of the liberation movements by our Organization as the true representatives of their territories, conclusions that must be more in keeping with the will and aspirations of the peoples concerned, who are fighting so courageously for their freedom, independence and the sovereignty of their countries. In this context the presence of Portugal in these Territories is an unbearable aggression, a criminal aggression that must be punished as such. For this reason my delegation requests the inclusion of a new item on the agenda, to be entitled \"Criminal aggression by Portugal against the sovereign State of Guinea-Bissau and the illegal occupation of certain parts of its national territory\".\n303.\tFor us, independence means the exercise of national sovereignty by the people. It is also, and above all, a protest against injustices and all the causes of injustice and insecurity that daily endanger peace and human lives. It is the inauguration of a world of peace and happiness that our people cry out for with all their strength.\n304.\tIn southern Africa the illegal regime of Ian Smith is joining in a common cause with the racists of Pretoria and Portugal to exacerbate to the point of paroxism, racial hatred and methods of repression. Threats, brutalities, arbitrary imprisonments, murder in cold blood have become the lot of the freedom fighters in that part of the world. In the face of this tragedy, which is reminiscent of the age of primitive hordes, my delegation continues to maintain that so long as Great Britain, the administering Power, does not satisfy the just claims of the people of Zimbabwe, who ask for the convening of a constitutional conference based on the principle \"one man, one vote\", that country remains fully responsible.\n305.\tI should like on behalf of my delegation at this point to pay a solemn tribute to the heroism of the militant people of the sister Republic of Zambia in the face of the numerous provocations of the imperialist oligarchies that are interlinked in southern Africa. The colonialist and racist regimes of southern Africa, powerless to stem the flow of the struggle for liberation, are now compelled to resort to other means. It is within that context that we must place the aggression and economic blackmail of the rebel Ian Smith against Zambia, which so victoriously took up the challenge.\n306.\tIndependent Africa, through its continental organization, OAU, has sufficiently highlighted and stigmatized the strengthening of the aggressiveness of the colonialists and racists by reason of the assistance they receive from their allies in the Western camp. Despite the determined sanctions of the international community, the economy of the partisans of segregation prospers still further and the armaments of the oppressors become more and more modern.\n307.\tThe Government of South Africa, despite the general condemnation of conscious and responsible mankind, continues to maintain our brothers under the heinous system of apartheid. The policy of the creation of \"Bantustans\" and the various forms of segregation remain the daily practice in South Africa. For Vorster and his clique the black man \u2014  unfortunately, we must say this \u2014 is no different from an animal, since according to that backward and insolent philosophy all those belonging to that race have no soul and no conscience and deserve none of the rights required for the happiness and dignity of our fellow men.\n308.\tThe almost unanimous position taken by the members of the General Assembly against the right to speak of the delegation of the white minority of South Africa was an eloquent manifestation of the condemnation of Vorster's policy of apartheid. In our view, that manifestation is but one stage in the struggle embarked upon by Africa, whose\nobjective is the occupation of the seat of South Africa by the authentic representatives of that part of the world.\n309.\tOn 4 February 1972, at its memorable meetings in Addis Ababa, the Security Council adopted its resolution 309 (1972), relating to Namibia. The events that have taken place since then have in no way changed the reactionary position of South Africa in Namibia. With obdurate cynicism they have opposed the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to find an equitable and peaceful solution. After the failure of the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, after the unanimous rejection by the tenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, and in the light of the results of the recent referendum held in that Territory, my delegation believes that the United Nations should envisage the possibility of taking other concrete steps in order that the people of Namibia may as soon as possible accede to independence and national sovereignty.\n310.\tAlthough the explosive situation obtaining in southern Africa is of the highest concern to us, we cannot pass over in silence the existence of other equally important\n. colonialist bastions in the continent: so-called French\nSomaliland, the Comoro islands, so-called Spanish Sahara, the Seychelles islands, and so forth.\n311.\tThe period of colonial domination is finished forever. All peoples without distinction must unconditionally enjoy their freedom.\n312.\tMy delegation feels that, if our Organization is to live up to the commitments proclaimed and accepted since San Francisco, it must use all the means at its disposal to defeat the forces that oppose the realization of its noble ideals.\n313.\tI should like now to turn to another problem which remains one of the constant preoccupations of our Organization \u2014 the Zionist aggression in the Middle East.\n314.\tBy creating out of nowhere the State of Israel, the United Nations has fanned the flames of a vast fire which it can no longer contain and which has acquired disquieting proportions.\n315.\tIsrael arbitrarily occupies by mere virtue of military power the territory of the brave Palestinian people, and this situation has lasted for 25 years. For 25 years, the Palestinian people chased from their fatherland have lived the errant life imposed on them by the Zionists.\n316.\tDespite repeated condemnation from the forces of peace throughout the world and the many resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, Israel has since June 1967 been occupying the territory of the Arab republics of Egypt and Syria.\n317.\tSupported by a most powerful ally, it arrogantly defied the whole of the international community. To the peace efforts of Africa and the Arab States it has always responded with contempt and arrogance.\n318.\tInevitably, that state of affairs led to the events of 6 October. Thus, with rarely equalled violence, there broke out the vast conflict latent since June 1967.\n319.\tOnce again the Middle East is at war. On 9 October, with indignation and consternation, the world learned of the bombing of Damascus, which led to the deaths of many civilian victims, among them diplomats and United Nations officials.\n320. The Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria must recover their usurped territory. Peace in the Middle East must be achieved at that price.\n321.\tOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of Guinea, I wish to reiterate to the peoples and Governments of the Arab States, and in particular to Egypt and Syria, the complete solidarity and unreserved support of the people and Government of my country for their just struggle against the Israeli invader.\n322.\tInternational imperialism has created other hotbeds of tension which it continues to maintain despite international disapproval.\n323.\tThe peace efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the reunification of its country still encounter numerous obstacles and a climate of continued tension maintained by the presence in South Korea of foreign troops.\n324.\tThus it is essential to hold as soon as possible a conference which would bring together representatives of all the population of the two Koreas to discuss problems concerning the future of the Korean fatherland. That is why my delegation opposes the premature admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations, which would sanction the definitive division of that country.\n325.\tBy withdrawing its armed forces and by ensuring scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of those States, the United Nations must help Korea recover its national unity.\n326.\tThe Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held from 5 to 9 September in Algiers, symbolized the resistance of oppressed peoples and was extremely well attended. The success of its work opened a new era in the history of the third world.\n327.\tBut, although we carefully follow those positive changes in the international situation, especially in the relations between the great Powers, the struggle of all the peaceful forces for the implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence and co-operation still meets with the active resistance of those that are in favour of war. Some of the great Powers, in order to create zones of influence for themselves, trample underfoot the elementary rights of peoples. The case of the Indo-Chinese peninsula is a typical example of this.\n328.\tMy delegation expresses its sincere concern at the recrudescence of military action in that region and invites the international community to use its good offices so that a just peace may be established in that part of South-East Asia.\n329.\tThe Republic of Guinea, which from the very first hours recognized the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, headed by His Majesty Prince Norodom Sihanouk, sincerely hopes that the United Nations will understand the legitimate aspirations of the Khmer people to manage their own affairs.\n330.\tIn Algiers the large majority of non-aligned countries gave their firm support to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam in its struggle for true independence.\n331.\tThe universality of the United Nations, which is one of the essential prerequisites for the achievement of the purposes and objectives of the San Francisco Charter, demands that all peoples make their contribution to the solution of the problems affecting mankind. Yet we note with regret the absence of the representatives of Viet-Nam, Korea, Palestine, the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and of all the liberation movements which we recognized in 1972 as being the only legitimate representatives of their territories. The presence here of certain men who represent only themselves, of usurpers of power, of oppressors of peoples, is an affront and causes us indignation.\n332.\tAmong the Powers that arrogate to themselves the right unilaterally to discuss serious questions affecting mankind, we find precisely those that are responsible for the problems besetting world security. This is a paradox! It is inconceivable because it is contrary to logic that one should be both the judge and the accused.\n333.\tIf our Organization wishes to fulfil its historic and sacred mission, namely, to save present and succeeding- generations from the scourge of war, if our Organization wishes to establish international peace and security that are real and complete, it must eliminate the causes of war and tension, and eradicate from international relations the spirit of political domination and economic injustice. To do so we must break with Byzantine discussions and resolutely search for appropriate ways and means to ensure respect for the spirit of our Charter.\n334.\tWe must proclaim as crimes against humanity any acts that run counter to the advent of a just and durable peace and we must all take a stand against acts that are contrary to morality, peace and security in the world. The struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, apartheid, zionism and all forms of aggression fall within this context and must be collectively supported by the United Nations because these phenomena are contrary to the principles upheld by our Organization. The internationalization of that struggle would enable our Organization to mobilize all its material, financial and military resources on behalf of the liberation forces. Thus we would show the peoples of the world that the United Nations strives to achieve the realization of their most fundamental and sacred aspirations.\n335.\tWe cannot, of course, achieve such results unless we revise the San Francisco Charter and adapt it to the new needs of our peoples. It goes without saying that the revision of the United Nations Charter and the strengthening of the structures of our international Organization demand greater democracy and equality among the Members, and that will be possible only if an end is put to the privileges given exclusively to some Powers. We must abolish the status of permanent member of the Security Council; we must abrogate the right of veto.\n336.\tThe main weakness of our Organization is due to the fact that only five of its Members, through the right of veto, hold in their hands the key to the solution of world problems.\n337.\tThis state of affairs is no longer in keeping with the realities of our century and constitutes a flagrant violation of the principle of democracy and a grave violation of the dignity of the large majority of the countries represented in this Assembly.\n338.\tOf all the international problems that polarize world public opinion, disarmament is unquestionably both the oldest and the most topical, because it is the one that has achieved the least possible progress. One speaks of it more as hobby than through real conviction. It goes without saying that there is still a game of hide and seek. The medium-sized and small States, when they bring up the question of disarmament, still have in mind the fact that infallibly they will come up against the resistance of the great Powers and thus will not succeed. As for the great Powers themselves, they have always subscribed to resolutions by which they have not felt themselves bound.\n339.\tThis year will mark the convening of the first session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, whose second session the General Assembly has scheduled to take place in 1974 [resolution 3029 A (XXVII)]. We attach to that Conference the importance that it deserves. We hope that in its deliberations it will duly take into account the demands of the developing world and its security needs. The need to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of my country, which is one of the main targets of imperialism, has led us to extend the limits of our territorial waters to 200 nautical miles. The importance that we attach to the forthcoming Conference on the Law of the Sea is explained by our constant desire for the speedy codification of certain rules and conditions whose adaptation to present realities is indispensable.\n340.\tThe Conference can and should be held as planned. However, by reason of the explosive situation at present prevailing in Chile, it would be desirable for the Conference to be held elsewhere. In that connexion, my delegation suggests that we reconsider paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 3029 A (XXVII), according to which it was decided to hold the second session of that Conference in Santiago.\n341.\tThe people of Guinea has followed with deep emotion the painful events which last month brought sorrow to the friendly Republic of Chile. Our delegation expresses its deep sympathy to the valiant people of Chile, which has remained faithful to the revolutionary ideals of President Salvador Allende.\n342.\tIn the world today, the contradictions that we find in Africa in its relations with the outside world result from the fact that the African economy is still exploited or dependent on outside countries. It is beset by increasing disparities between the prices of our primary commodities and those of the goods sold to us from outside Africa. The terms of trade bring new concern each day to our peoples, whose creative efforts are annihilated by a system that always tends to aggravate the living conditions of the producers in our continent. Therefore we must take a decision as early as possible to lay the foundation of an economic policy that reflects our determination to achieve the decolonization of our continent and ensure effective solidarity for our peoples in this area.\n343.\tIt was because of a desire to defend these interests that the tenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and G6vernment of the OAU in Addis Ababa adopted the African declaration on economic co-operation, development and independence.\n344.\tThe sincere co-operation that we wish to obtain from the developed countries must, come even more from the United Nations, in which we place our confidence. In fact we note that often the loans it grants through its bodies increase our debts rather than help us. Often over half the sum allocated to projects in our countries is used for endless studies and for the travel expenses of experts. Finally, when the projects have no more funds, they are merely abandoned.\n345.\tI should not wish to end this intervention without saying a few words about the drought that has recently afflicted six States in the Sudano-Sahelian region and which has ravaged in an unprecedented way the population and livestock of that region. My delegation will not dwell on the details of that situation, which has been sufficiently explained by many delegations that have spoken before me and which was the subject of an eloquent statement by General Lamizana, President of the sister Republic of the Upper Volta, under special mandate from the meeting at Ouagadougou of the six countries concerned. [2145th meeting].\n346.\tI shall confine myself to expressing my sincere thanks on behalf of my Government to all those who have responded to the appeal of our brothers in distress. I should like to emphasize, however, that, while the immediate needs of these countries have been met to some extent with the assistance received, much remains to be done to eliminate the sequels of this disaster and to restore normal life to that agro-pastoral region.\n347.\tIt is for this reason that we call for the collaboration of the international Organization in order that it may take concrete measures to reconstruct the economy of the States of the Sudano-Sahelian area so that they can face up to these calamities and others of the same kind in the future.", "meta": {"doc_id":

{"text": "43. Madam President, Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers and representatives \u2014 my fellow citizens of the world community.\n\n44. I first wish to express my deep appreciation of the honour of addressing this Organization for the first time and also to take this opportunity of welcoming all\nthose from 126 countries who are here at the United Nations General Assembly session. Particularly, on a personal note, I appreciate the opportunity of having been\nwelcomed today by the Secretary-General. It is hard to realize \u2014 we were reminiscing about this \u2014 that just sixteen years ago he welcomed me to Burma when he was\nChief of Protocol and I was Vice-President. Since then we have both come up in the world to a certain extent.\n\n45. I think we would all agree that there is no nobler destiny, nor any greater gift that one age could make to the ages that follow, than to forge the key to a\nlasting peace. And in this great Assembly the desirability of peace needs no affirmation. The methods of achieving it are what so greatly challenge our courage,\nour intelligence and our discernment. Surely, if one lesson above all rings resoundingly among the many shattered hopes in this world, it is that good words are not a substitute for hard deeds, and noble rhetoric is no guarantee of noble results.\n\n46. We might describe peace as a process embodied in a structure. For centuries peace was the absence of war and stability was the absence of change. But in today\u2019s\nworld there can be no stability without change \u2014 so that peace becomes a continuing process of creative evolution. It is no longer enough to restrain war. Peace must\nalso embrace progress both in satisfying man\u2019s material needs and in fulfilling his spiritual needs.\n\n47. The text of the structure of peace is that it ensure for \u2018the people of each nation the integrity of their borders, their right to develop in peace and safety\nand their right to determine their own destiny without outside interference. As long as we live with the threat of aggression, we need physical restraints to\ncontain it. But the truest peace is based on self-restraint\u2014on the voluntary acceptance of those basic rules of behaviour that are rooted in mutual respect and\ndemonstrated in mutual forbearance. The more closely the world community adheres to a single standard in judging international behaviour, the less likely that\nstandard is to be violated.\n\n48. I am well aware that many nations have questions about the world role of the United States in the years ahead, about the nature and extent of our future\ncontribution to the structure of peace. Let me address those doubts \u2014 and let me address them quite candidly\u2014before this Organization.\n\n49. In recent years there has been mounting criticism here in the United States of the scope and the results of our international commitments. This trend, however,\nhas not been confined to the United States alone. In many countries we find a tendency to withdraw from responsibilities, to leave the world\u2019s often frustrating\nproblems to the other fellow and just to hope for the best. As for the United States, I can state here today without qualification: we have not turned away from the\nworld. We know that with power goes responsibility. We are neither boastful of our power nor apologetic about it. We recognize that it exists; and that, as well as\nconferring certain advantages, it also imposes upon us certain obligations.\n\n50. As the world changes, the pattern of those obligations and responsibilities changes. At the end of the Second World War, the United States for the first time in\nhistory assumed the major responsibility for world peace. We were left in 1945 as the one nation with sufficient strength to contain the new threats of aggression\nand with sufficient wealth to help the injured nations back onto their feet. For much of the world, those first difficult post-war years were a time of dependency.\nThe next step was towards independence, as new nations were born and old nations revived. Now we are maturing together into a new pattern of interdependence.\n\n51. It is against this background that we have been urging other nations to assume a greater share of responsibility for their own security, both individually and\ntogether with their neighbours. The great challenge now is to enlist the co-operation of many nations in preserving peace and in enriching life. This cannot be done\nby American edict or by the edict of any other nation. It must reflect the concepts and the wishes of the people of those nations themselves.\n\n52. The history of the post-war period teaches that nationalism can be dangerously disruptive \u2014 or powerfully creative. Our aim is to encourage the creative forms\nof nationalism; to join as partners where our partnership is appropriate and where it is wanted, but not to let a United States presence substitute for independent\nnational effort or infringe on national dignity and national pride.\n\n53. It is not my belief that the way to peace is by giving up our friends or letting down our allies. On the contrary, our aim is to place America\u2019s international\ncommitments on a sustainable long-term basis, to encourage local and regional initiatives, to foster national independence and self-sufficiency, and by so doing to\nstrengthen the total fabric of peace. It would be dishonest, particularly before this sophisticated audience, to pretend that the United States has no national interests of its own or no special concern for its own interests. However, our most fundamental national interest is in maintaining that structure of international stability on which peace depends and which makes orderly progress possible.\n\n54, Since I took office as President, no single question has occupied so much of my time and energy as the search for an end to the war in Viet-Nam \u2014 an end fair to\nthe people of South Viet-Nam, fair to the people of North Viet-Nam, and fair to those others who would be affected by the outcome. We in the United States want to end\nthis war, and we are ready to take every reasonable step to achieve that goal. But let there be no question on this one fundamental point: in good conscience we cannot,\nin the long-term interests of peace we will not, accept a settlement that would arbitrarily dictate the political future of South Viet-Nam and deny the people of South Viet-Nam the basic right to determine their own future free from any outside interference.\n\n55. As I put it in my address to the American people last May: \u201cWhat the United States wants for South Viet-Nam is not the important thing. What North Viet-Nam wants for South Viet-Nam is not the important thing. What is important is what the people of South Viet-Nam want for South Viet-Nam.\u201c To secure this right, and to secure\nthis principle, is our one limited but fundamental objective.\n\n56. Both in public and at the Paris talks, we have offered a number of proposals which would bring peace and provide self-determination. And we are ready to consider any other proposals that have the same objective. The missing ingredient so far has been the willingness of the other side to talk on any terms other than those that would predetermine the result and deny the right. of self-determination to the people of South Viet-Nam. Once that willingness exists, and once there is a genuine willingness by the other side to reach agreement, the practical solutions can readily be found.\n\n57. This makes it urgent that the Members of the United Nations \u2014 those in this room \u2014 who have long taken an active interest in peace, in Viet-Nam now take an active\nhand in achieving it. Many urged that if only we halted our bombing of the North, peace would follow. Nearly a year has passed since the bombing of the North was\nhalted. Three months have passed since we began the process of troop replacement, signalling both our own genuine desire for a settlement and the increased readiness\nof the South Viet-Namese to manage their own defence.\n\n58. As I announced on Tuesday, 18 September 1969, by 15 December our troop strength in Viet-Nam will have been reduced by a minimum: of 60,000 men. On 2 September,\nNorth Viet-Nam's chief negotiator in Paris said that if the United States committed itself to the principle of totally withdrawing its forces from South Viet-Nam,\nand if it withdrew a significant number of troops, Hanoi would take this into account.\n\n59. I repeat here today what I said in my speech on 14 May, that we are prepared to withdraw all our forces from South Viet-Nam; and the replacement of 60,000 troops\nis a significant step. The time has come for the other side to respond to these initiatives. The time has come for peace.\n\n60. In the name of peace I urge all of you here - representing 126 nations \u2014 to use your best diplomatic efforts to persuade Hanoi to move seriously into the\nnegotiations which could end this war. The steps we have taken have been responsive to views expressed in this room. And we hope that views from this Organization\nmay also be influential in Hanoi. If these efforts are successful, this war can end.\n\n61. The people of Viet-Nam, North and South alike, have demonstrated heroism enough to last a century \u2014 and I sneak from personal observation. I have been to North\nViet-Nam, to Hanoi, in 1953, and all over South Viet-Nam. I have seen the people of the North and the people of the South. The people of: Viet-Nam, North and South,\nhave endured an unspeakable weight of suffering for a generation and they deserve a better future. When the war ends, the United States will stand ready to help the\npeople of Viet-Nam \u2014 all of them \u2014 in their tasks of renewal and reconstruction. And when peace comes at last to Viet-Nam, it can truly come with healing in its wings.\n\n62. In relations between the United States and the various Communist Powers, I have said that we should move from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation.\n\n63. I believe our relations with the Soviet Union can be conducted in a spirit of mutual respect, recognizing our differences and also our right to differ;\nrecognizing our divergent interests, and also our common interests; recognizing the interests of our respective allies, as well as our own. Now, it would be idle to\npretend that there are not major problems between us, and conflicting interests. The tensions of the past thirty years have not been caused by mere personal\nmisunderstandings. This is why we have indicated the need for extended negotiations on a broad front of issues.\n\n64. Already, as you know, we have had extensive consultations with the Soviet Union as well as with others about the Middle East, where events of the past few days\npoint up anew the urgency of a stable peace. The United States continues to believe that the United Nations cease-fire resolutions define the minimal conditions that\nmust prevail on the ground if settlement is to be achieved in the Middle East. We believe the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)] charts the\nway to that settlement. A peace, to be lasting, must leave no seed of a future war. It must rest on a settlement which both sides have a vested interest in maintaining.\n\n65. We seek a settlement based on respect for the sovereign right of each nation in the area to exist within secure and recognized boundaries. We are convinced that\npeace cannot be achieved on the basis of substantial alterations in the map of the Middle East. We are equally convinced that peace cannot be achieved on the basis of\nanything less than a binding, irrevocable commitment by the parties to live together in peace.\n\n66. Failing a settlement, an agreement on the limitation of the shipment of arms to the Middle East might help to stabilize the situation. We have indicated to the\nSoviet Union, without result, our willingness to enter such discussions.\n\n67. In addition to our talks on the Middle East we hope soon to begin talks with the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic arms. There is no more important\ntask before us. The date we propose for the opening of talks has passed for lack of response. We remain ready to enter negotiations. Since the United States first\nproposed strategic arms talks three years ago, the task of devising an effective agreement has become more difficult. The Soviet Union has been vigorously expanding\nits strategic forces; weapons systems themselves have become more sophisticated, more destructive. But as the difficulty of the talks increases, so too does their\nimportance. Though the issues are complex, we are prepared to deal with them seriously, concretely and purposefully\u2014and to make a determined effort not only to\nlimit the build-up of strategic arms, but to reverse it.\n\n68. Meanwhile, I want to affirm our support for arms control proposals which we hope the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament will place before this\nAssembly with regard to the sea-bed and to chemical and bacteriological warfare. We hope also that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution\n2373 (XXII)] will soon enter into force. We should be under no illusion, however, that arms control will itself bring peace. Wars are fought by soldiers, but they are\ndeclared by politicians. Peace also requires progress on those stubbornly persistent political questions, questions that are considered in this room, questions that\nstill divide the world; and it requires other exchanges, not only of words but of deeds, that can gradually weave a fabric of mutual trust among the nations and the\npeoples of the world.\n\n69. We intend to conduct our negotiations with the Soviet Union soberly and seriously, neither encumbered by prejudice nor blinded by sentimentality, seeking to reach\nagreements rather than to make propaganda.\n\n70. Whenever the leaders of Communist China choose to abandon their self-imposed isolation, we are ready to talk with them in the same frank and serious spirit.\n\n71. For nearly a quarter of a century the United Nations has struggled with the often thankless task of peace-keeping. As we look to the future, however, keeping the\npeace is only part of our task. We also must, concentrate on building the peace.\n\n72. Let us be candid. There are many differences among the great Powers, and among other Powers, which as realists we know cannot be resolved quickly, cannot be resolved\neven by this Organization. But we also know that there are at least five areas in particular of great concern to everyone here, with regard to which there should be\nno national differences, in which our interests are common and on which there should be unanimity. They are these: securing the safety of international air travel;\nencouraging international voluntary service; fostering economic development and population control; protecting our threatened environment; exploring the frontiers of space.\n\n73. By any standards, aircraft hijackings are morally, politically and legally indefensible. The Tokyo Convention has now been brought into force, providing for prompt release of passengers, crew and aircraft. Along with other nations, we also are working on a new convention for the punishment of hijackers. but neither of these conventions can be fully effective without co-operation. Sky piracy cannot be ended as long as the pirates receive asylum.\n\n74. Consequently, I urge the United Nations to give high priority to this matter. This is an issue that transcends politics. There is no need for it to become the subject\nof polemics or a focus of political differences. It involves the interests of every nation, the safety of every air passenger and the integrity of that structure of\norder on which a world community depends.\n\n75. The creative, dynamic kind of peace I have spoken of, of course, requires more than such basic protections as the one I have just described. To build this kind\nof peace, we must join together in building our societies \u2014 in raising a great cathedral of the spirit, which celebrates the infinite possibilities of man himself.\n\n76, Such a peace requires a fuller enlistment not only of Government resources and of private enterprise resources, but also of the dedication and skill of those\nthousands of people all over the world who are ready to volunteer in the cause of human achievement. Our own Peace Corps has helped in many countries. I especially welcome the consideration which the United Nations itself is now giving to the establishment of an international volunteer corps. We stand ready to give this exciting new venture our full and enthusiastic co-operation.\n\n77. As the United Nations looks toward the beginning of its Second Development Decade, it faces a time of enormous challenge but enormous opportunity. We can only guess at the new scientific discoveries that the 1970s may bring, but we can see with chilling clarity the gap already exists between the developed economies and the economies of the developing countries, and the urgent need for international co-operation in spurring economic development.\n\n79. Increasingly, the task of protecting man\u2019s environment is a matter of international concern. Pollution of air and water, upsetting the balance of nature \u2014\nthese are not only local problems and not only national problems, but matters that affect the basic relationships of man to his planet. The United Nations already is\nplanning a conference on the human environment in 1972, and I pledge the strongest support of the United States for that effort. I hope that even before then we can\nlaunch new national and international initiatives toward restoring the balance of nature and maintaining our world as a healthy and hospitable place for man.\n\n80. Of all man\u2019s great enterprises, none lends itself more logically or more compellingly to international co-operation than the venture into space. Here, truly,\nmankind is as one, as fellow creatures from the planet Earth exploring the heavens that all of us enjoy.\n\n81. The journey of Apollo 11 to the moon and back was not an end, but the beginning. There will be new journeys of discovery, and beyond this we are just beginning to\ncomprehend the benefits that space technology can yield here on earth. But the potential is enormous. For example, we now are developing earth resource survey satellites, with the first experimental satellite to be launched some time early in the decade of the 1970s. Present indications are that these satellites should be capable of yielding data which could assist in as widely varied tasks as these: the location of schools of fish in the oceans, the location of mineral deposits on land, the health of agricultural crops.\n\n82. I feel it is only right that we should share both the adventures and the benefits of space. As an example of our plans, we have determined to take actions with\nregard to earth resource satellites, as this programme proceeds and fulfils its promise. The purpose of those actions is that this programme would be dedicated to\nproduce information not only for the United States, but also for the world community. We shall be putting several proposals in this respect before the United Nations.\nThese are among the positive, concrete steps we intend to take towards internationalizing man\u2019s epic venture into space\u2014an adventure that belongs not to one nation, but to all mankind, and one that should be marked not by rivalry, but by the same spirit of fraternal co-operation that so long has been the hallmark of the\ninternational community of science.\n\n83. And now, Madam  President and Mr. Secretary-General, may I speak a personal word to the representatives gathered in this hall. I recognize that those here are\ndedicating their lives to the cause of peace and that what is done in this hall will have an enormous effect on the future of peace. I have had the great privilege\nover the past twenty-three years of travelling to most of the countries represented in this hall. I have met most of the leaders of the nations represented in this\nhall, and I have seen literally thousands of people in most of the countries represented in this hall. There are differences between the nations and differences between the leaders and differences between the people in this world. But based on my own experience, of this one thing I am sure: the people of the world, wherever they are, want peace. And those of us who have the responsibilities for leadership in the world have an overwhelming world mandate from the people of the nations we represent to bring peace, to keep the peace and to build the peace.\n\n84. I realize that a survey of history might discourage those who seek to establish peace. But we have entered a new age, different not only in degree but in kind\nfrom any that has gone before. For the first time ever, we have truly become a single world community. For the first time ever, we have seen the staggering fury of\nthe power of the universe unleashed, and we know that we hold that power in a very precarious balance. For the first time ever, technological advance has brought\nwithin reach what once was only a poignant dream for hundreds of millions: freedom from hunger and freedom from want \u2014 want and hunger that I have personally seen\nin nation after nation all over this world. For the first time ever, we have seen changes in a single lifetime \u2014 in our lifetime \u2014 that dwarf the achievements of\ncenturies before; and those changes continue to accelerate. And for the first time ever, man has stepped beyond his planet, and revealed us to ourselves as\n\u201criders on the Earth together\u201d, bound inseparably on this one bright, beautiful speck in the heavens, so tiny in the universe and so incomparably welcoming as a\nhome for man.\n\n85. In this new age of \"firsts\u201d, even the goal of a just and lasting peace is a \u201cfirst\u201d we can dare to strive for. We must achieve it. And I believe we can achieve it.\n\n86. In that spirit, then, let us press towards an open world\u2014a world of open doors, open hearts, open minds; a world open to the exchange of ideas and of people, and\nopen to the reach of the human spirit; a world open in the search for truth and unconcerned with the fate of old dogmas and old isms; a world open at last to the light of justice and the light of reason, and to the achievement of that true peace which the people of every land carry in their hearts and celebrate in their hopes.\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "USA_24_1969", "year": 1969}, "spans": [{"start": 2517, "end": 2530, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 496, "token_end": 498}, {"start": 2791, "end": 2808, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 550, "token_end": 553}, {"start": 2922, "end": 2935, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 576, "token_end": 578}, {"start": 3121, "end": 3138, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 615, "token_end": 618}, {"start": 3585, "end": 3602, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 708, "token_end": 711}, {"start": 4442, "end": 4450, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 874, "token_end": 875}, {"start": 4859, "end": 4872, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 956, "token_end": 958}, {"start": 5117, "end": 5124, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1008, "token_end": 1009}, {"start": 5431, "end": 5448, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1064, "token_end": 1067}, {"start": 5845, "end": 5853, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1141, "token_end": 1144}, {"start": 5885, "end": 5895, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1153, "token_end": 1155}, {"start": 5929, "end": 5937, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1164, "token_end": 1167}, {"start": 6008, "end": 6025, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1183, "token_end": 1186}, {"start": 6331, "end": 6341, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1250, "token_end": 1252}, {"start": 6369, "end": 6379, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1259, "token_end": 1261}, {"start": 6504, "end": 6512, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1289, "token_end": 1290}, {"start": 6540, "end": 6553, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1297, "token_end": 1299}, {"start": 6564, "end": 6574, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1301, "token_end": 1303}, {"start": 6618, "end": 6626, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1313, "token_end": 1316}, {"start": 6637, "end": 6647, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1318, "token_end": 1320}, {"start": 6720, "end": 6730, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1336, "token_end": 1338}, {"start": 6744, "end": 6754, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1342, "token_end": 1344}, {"start": 7281, "end": 7291, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1451, "token_end": 1453}, {"start": 7591, "end": 7595, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1515, "token_end": 1516}, {"start": 7954, "end": 7964, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1589, "token_end": 1591}, {"start": 8089, "end": 8097, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1619, "token_end": 1622}, {"start": 8222, "end": 8239, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1651, "token_end": 1654}, {"start": 8313, "end": 8323, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1665, "token_end": 1667}, {"start": 8530, "end": 8540, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1715, "token_end": 1717}, {"start": 9131, "end": 9139, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1842, "token_end": 1845}, {"start": 9277, "end": 9285, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1873, "token_end": 1876}, {"start": 9319, "end": 9329, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1886, "token_end": 1888}, {"start": 9415, "end": 9423, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1910, "token_end": 1913}, {"start": 9560, "end": 9577, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1941, "token_end": 1944}, {"start": 9617, "end": 9625, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1953, "token_end": 1956}, {"start": 9720, "end": 9724, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1976, "token_end": 1977}, {"start": 9801, "end": 9818, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1996, "token_end": 1999}, {"start": 9974, "end": 9990, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2031, "token_end": 2034}, {"start": 10599, "end": 10615, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2152, "token_end": 2155}, {"start": 10741, "end": 10758, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2183, "token_end": 2186}, {"start": 11786, "end": 11802, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2391, "token_end": 2395}, {"start": 11945, "end": 11961, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2425, "token_end": 2428}, {"start": 12165, "end": 12182, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2469, "token_end": 2472}, {"start": 12307, "end": 12323, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2494, "token_end": 2497}, {"start": 13630, "end": 13646, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2752, "token_end": 2755}, {"start": 14974, "end": 14979, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3010, "token_end": 3011}, {"start": 17462, "end": 17475, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3480, "token_end": 3482}, {"start": 19011, "end": 19028, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3780, "token_end": 3783}, {"start": 19517, "end": 19522, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3882, "token_end": 3883}]}
{"text": " Mr. President, I have the honor to convey to you the congratulations and best wishes of the Government and people of the Republic of Vanuatu. Your unanimous election to preside over the forty-first session of the General Assembly is a tribute to you and to the Government and people of Bangladesh. We add our voice to that of those who have already spoken so eloquently of your broad experience, your skills and your dedication to the principles and ideals which unite us in this world body.\nWe congratulate your illustrious predecessor, Jaime de Pinies, for the outstanding manner in which he carried out the duties of President. We also associate ourselves with the many expressions of appreciation and praise for the work of our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.\nWe are pleased to see that the Secretary-General's health has been restored. It is to be hoped that we, the nations of the world, will ease the burden of his high office by following up our expressions of praise with concrete deeds that are consistent with our Charter and the sentiments expressed by those moving words. Matching our deeds to the words might assure the future good health of our Secretary-General and the United Nations itself. Such a course of action might even assure the good health of our very troubled world.\nLast year at this time we gathered to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization. For a brief period, the world's attention was focused on the United Nations and the dramatic activities here at Headquarters. A few observers were drawn to, and mesmerized by, the obvious glamor and excitement of that historic event. Most, however, waited anxiously for the results of our thought and reflection on what had been achieved during our first 40 years and what had not, where we have been and where we are going. For us, and for most of the world, it was less a period of celebration and more a period of critical evaluation.\nToday , we are not commemorating a notable anniversary. There fore, fewer cameras, microphones, flashbulbs and notepads are present. Fewer words are written, fewer said, and even fewer listened to. None the less, what we say and do at this session will be just as important and crucial to the future of the human race as what was said and done at the last session.\nThis year, the mood is quieter and more subdued. The airports, hotels and restaurants of our host city are not quite as crowded today as they were c\none year ago. The streets and highways approaching the United Nations are not as jammed with official motorcades, and the general public is not- as affected by, and therefore not as concerned with, our deliberations. However, as little has changed foe the better since we -last met, our current session is, in a very real sense, every bit as dramatic, urgent and intense as the last. A cursory glance around the globe reveals why.\nThe prisons of South Africa are even fuller than they were one year ago. The refugee camps that house the people of Palestine are even more crowded than they were one year ago. More people have been killed as a result of the senseless and tragic war between Iran and Iraq. In Lebanon, more children have been deprived of the innocence of youth and turned into soldiers as even more death and destruction have been visited upon that once serene land. Cyprus continues to be divided and occupied by a powerful neighbor.\nMore debt has accumulated in South America, threatening that continent's democratic advances. More firepower and less development aid has been pledged to the people of Central America, and new obstacles have been placed in the path of the Contadora process. A few still speak of the \"five\" States in Central America, forgetting the existence of Belize, and the fact that it is a home to many refugees and that it, too, is vulnerable to the region's instability.\nThe people of Kampuchea and Afghanistan are no closer to being allowed to live in peace and choose their own destinies, free from all forms of foreign interference, than they were one year ago. The people of East Timor, and those of other territories in our region, are no closer to being free to determine their own futures that they were one year ago.\nWe are no closer to seeing a referendum held in Western Sahara than we were last year at this time. South Africa is no closer to aiding its illegal occupation of Namibia than it was one year ago. Certain foreign economic interests are no closer to ending their illegal and immoral looting and pillage of Namibia's resources than they were one year ago.\nThe illegal traffic in deadly drugs has increased, and more young lives have been ruined, if not ended, as a result. Individual and State terrorism continue unabated in absolute defiance of every known standard of decency and common sense. France continues to test its nuclear weapons in our region, disregarding the objections of the countries of the region and the harm caused to our environment.\nThroughout the world, more people are hungry, homeless, unemployed and, as a result, frustrated or without hope. Gaps in real income between nations and between individuals have widened. Everywhere one looks, the rich have become richer and the poor have become poorer. Yet, somehow, in the midst of all of this, the inventory of nuclear weapons has grown larger.\nDespite all of this, there is a faint glimmer of hope. FOr millions of people in every corner of the earth, the United Nations still represents mankind's finest qualities. It symbolizes their dream of justice, equality, and peace. They care little about celebrations and commemorations. Diplomatic dinners and receptions are very remote to them, but the United Nations and its specialized agencies are not. That is why we must make sure that the Organization is not destroyed or emasculated, but instead strengthened and made even more relevant.\nThe financial crisis facing the United Nations is, as everyone knows, in reality a major political crisis. As such, it commands our attention and demands, above all else, our candor.\nA great deal has been written, and even more has been said, on the subject of the imperfections of the United Nations. Critics point to our lengthy debates, repetitive speeches, strident resolutions, and our frequent waste and inefficiency. The criticisms are not completely without merit. There is considerable room for improvement.\nHowever, one must ask why the United Nations' most vociferous critics do not begin with a candid self-examination. What measures have they taken to correct similar, if not worse, shortcomings  in the various national and local governmental bodies of their own respective jurisdictions? Are we to believe that the United Nations is unique in its frequent waste and inefficiency? Is this the only place where there are too many lengthy speeches and too many divisive resolutions? Of course not.\nLet us pause for a moment and carefully consider what the most vocal critics have to say about the excessive number of resolutions passed each year. We happen to agree with that criticism. However, it does not go far enough. We should also ask why Cyprus is still occupied*, why the Palestinians still can't go home or even call their hone their home; why apartheid still exists in South Africa; why Namibia is still not interdependently so many other questions on our agenda are unresolved.\nHad the earlier, more moderate resolutions been implemented, most of those problems would have been resolved, and others might not have arisen. If today's resolutions are more militant, or strident in tone, the fault may not lie\nexclusively with the authors of the resolutions. Those who, while haying it in their power to restrain or reform those States that have ignored their obligations under our Charter, have chosen not to exercise that power, must also share the responsibility. Their repeated failure to help us implement the expressed will of the international community has led to the situation they now abhor.\nThe occasional inability to be exact and concise in our various resolutions is, we agree, a serious and regrettable deficiency. However, it is a deficiency of form. On the other hand, actively frustrating the will of our international democracy in so many instances is a substantive shortcoming. That is even more regrettable.\nThere is no doubt that we should consider changes in some of our practices and procedures, and perhaps even in some aspects of the structure of the United Nations. However, we must be careful not, as the saying goes, \"to throw out the baby with the bath water\". Change and reform are two-way avenues. We cannot be expected to consider making some changes but not others. Nor can we reform the Organization without a willingness by most of our Members to modify their behavior and a willingness by other to reform themselves.\nThe report of the Group of High-Lev el Intergovernmental Experts is an important document. It is obvious that considerable thought and effort have been expended in its preparation. We commend the Group of 18 for its labor on our behalf. The conclusions of their report merit our careful consideration, as it is obvious that we have reached a critical stage in the history of this Organization and another very critical stage in the process of international co-operation.\nThis year, as in past years, we have been reminded of mankind's vulnerabilities and imperfections. In lands an geographically removed from each other as the Solomon Islands and the Cameroons, death and destruction have struck without warning, in the form of an unusually severe cyclone in one instance and of a volcanic gas leak in the other. It is almost as if nature had chosen those harsh methods of delivering a painful reminder of its mystery, its power and the fact that as individual nations we are all vulnerable.\nIn lands as politically remote from each other as the United States and the Soviet Union, two separate incidents involving imperfect technology and human miscalculation have caused major disasters that have.had an impact upon and traumatized people far beyond the borders of those two powerful States. The tragic explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and the equally tragic accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant point to mankind's scientific imperfections and the very thin margin of error between scientific progress and disaster. In a related sense those two accidents also bring to mind the thin margin of error between the policy of nuclear deterrence and the potential accidental nuclear annihilation of the entire human race. They remind us that unless we work together no amount of technology can save our species from its own inventions.\nHow many more reminders will have to be given before an even greater disaster occurs? what further lesson do we peed? Must we see more evidence of the homicidal and suicidal nature of the nuclear-arms race or may we finally say that enough is not only enough but more than enough?\nAs President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev prepare for their second summit meeting we note the positive step evidenced by the recently concluded Stockholm accord. It is to be hoped that the flexibility demonstrated in the final stages of the negotiation of that accord and the trust and confidence evidenced in its terms will enable them to take further steps on the long road to a lasting and stable peace.\nThe establishment of trust and confidence in Europe is but one dimension of the world-wide search for peace. Trust and confidence in the process of multilateralism must also be evident in our work here at the united Nations, to ensure the continued relevance of the Organization and its value to future generations. Not one of our countries, large or small, East or West, North or South, can afford to denigrate this Organization in word or deed. We all need the United Nations. Some of us simply recognize that we need it more than others of us care to admit.\nI now turn to southern Africa. That area, more than any other, tests the will and resolve of the international community. The late W. E. B. DuBois wrote in his most noted passage that \"the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line\". I doubt that this renowned historian, despite his wisdom and acumen, knew how prophetic those words would be. He was born in a society that had only recently ended its own form of legalized slavery. Racism was still prevalent in the land of his birth. Segregation was the accepted code of behavior. Africa, Asia and the Caribbean were colonized. The peoples of those regions were locked in the grip of those who saw them as mere subhuman producers of raw materials for their hungry factories.\nA great deal has changed since his time. DuBois and others managed, through decades of difficult struggle, to overcome the segregationists and change the face and the soul of the land of their birth. Their children now know hope where before they knew only despair. Most of the countries of Africa, Asia and the Caribbean are, through the efforts of their respective peoples, now politically independent. Their children also know hope where once they knew only despair.\nUnfortunately, South Africa is a land untouched by the passage of time. Despite its twentieth century technology, its people continue to be victims of the backward attitudes of the nineteenth century. Even in death South Africa's people are victimized. A few weeks ago, at a place called Evander, 177 human beings lost their lives in a gold-mine accident. That disaster could have been avoided but concern for the safety of African miners is not an attribute of South Africa. The company involved identified the five dead whites by name, occupation and marital status and gave details of how many children each had. The 172 dead blacks were identified only as members of different tribes. Even in death they were given no dignity. This was not South Africa's worst mining accident and it is not the worst example of the South African regime's inhumanity. It is, however, a good example of how pervasive that regime's racism is. Recent cosmetic changes are almost meaningless. Despite the efforts of some to paint a different picture, its intransigence and unwillingness to change in any substantive manner are as evident today as they were yesterday.\nThe apartheid regime is not content with terrorizing the people of South Africa. Its system has also been imposed on the people of Namibia and threatens the survival of each of the front-line States. That regime, in fact, challenges every member of the United Nations.\nNone of us could possibly accept such behavior in our own countries, why, then, do we still permit those storm troopers in Pretoria to call themselves a legitimate Government? Why do some of us still hesitate to align ourselves with the people who seek nothing more than the right to walk the land of their own country as free human beings? Why do same of us close our eyes to the fact that the Pretoria regime has already imposed sanctions on neighboring African States in an effort to make them betray their own principles and their own people? How can those who oppose sanctions claim to be motivated by concern for South Africa's black population when apartheid itself is nothing more than the institutionalization of sanctions against that same population? How much longer must the world wait for some finally to decide to join the battle against this evil? What degree of brutality and callousness will finally move them to action? Must we wait until the next century for their attitudes to catch up with those of this century?\nTurning to our own area, the South Pacific, we draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that ours is a part of the world that contains many of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories. We seldom fail to mention this, because nothing poses a graver threat to the stability and tranquility of our region and nothing is in greater contradiction of the Charter of the United Nations and its various pronouncements.\nIn the modern world colonialism is just as much an anachronism as apartheid. What could be more outdated than the notion that the people of any territory are incapable of deciding for themselves who they are, what they wish to be and how they choose to live? That is why the maintenance of colonialism in the midst of the South Pacific region is unacceptable. The States of our region speak with one clear voice on the subject. We are as convinced of this as are the States of other regions that colonialism has no place in their midst.\nIn August, the Heads of Government of the 13 member States of the South Pacific Forum decided to ask the United Nations to place New Caledonia on its list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. That step had been considered in the past but had not been taken. In the past, the Forum countries believed that the administering Power recognized its responsibilities in the area of decolonization and that it would act accordingly. The events of the past year have now convinced us otherwise.\nIn September, the Heads of State or Government of the 101-member Movement of Non-Aligned Countries supported our regional initiative. At the eighth summit conference in Harare, Zimbabwe, the Heads of State or Government strongly urged the forty-first session of the General Assembly to place New Caledonia on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. They also admitted New Caledonia's independence movement, the Front de Liberation Nationale Ranak et Socialiste (FLNRS) as an observer. Vanuatu, having joined in those unanimous decisions, now anticipates that the General Assembly will itself take appropriate action.\nHe seek no quarrel with the administering Power and will not be provoked into one. If we are called names or if stones are cast in our direction we will not respond in kind. The principles involved are too lofty, our Charter is too explicit and the various resolutions are too clear for us to allow ourselves to be dragged into such a useless and senseless exercise.\nWe have been told that this is all our fault. How can that be so? It was not Vanuatu that colonized New Caledonia. It was not Vanuatu that drafted the Charter of the United Nations. It was not Vanuatu that was the author of the various resolutions on decolonization. It was not a representative of Vanuatu who first uttered the words \"liberty, equality, fraternity\".\nWe cannot take individual credit. Vanuatu is only one of 13 countries in the South Pacific For una, one of 99 countries and two liberation movements in the Hon-Aligned Movement and one of 159 coin tries in the United Nations.\nOn another day, we were told that Australia was to blame* on another day, it was New Zealand> on another, Fiji ; on yet another, Papua New Guinea; and on other days the Solomon Islands or Samoa. Everyone has been given credit for causing the case of New Caledonia to be brought to the united Nations except the one party which really deserves the credit; the administering Power. It chose not to proceed with what it had promised the colonized people of New Caledonia. Therefore it can blame no one but itself.\nWe have also been bold that economic aid to Vanuatu will be terminated if we persist in bringing the question of New Caledonia to the united Nations. This is a most unfortunate suggestion. Naturally we do not want to see this aid terminated. Vanuatu is, after all, a small developing country. In fact it is one of the least developed countries. However, we will not be intimidated in this way or in any other manner.\nSimilar threats have been made and carried out against other countries. Vanuatu is not the first and will probably not be the last to be threatened in this fashion. We regret this, but such is life. We have always believed that the administering Power is above such actions. We still hope that it is. However, if it is not, Vanuatu will survive, and New Caledonia will still become independent. Nothing will stop that process.\nFinally, we were also told that the Political Declaration by the Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Coin tries was meaningless. \"They do not mean it,\" we were told. \"They will change their minds when they get to the United Nations,\" we heard.\nWe find it incredible that anyone should believe that the leaders of the non-aligned countries are not serious when they issue a political declaration. It is fathomable to us that anyone would believe that they do not mean what they say and say what they mean. How could anyone expect representatives of the non-aligned countries at the United Nations to act contrary to a clear and explicit declaration made by their Heads of state or Government?\nMore incredibly, how could anyone expect non-aligned Members of the United Nations to forget their own histories and reverse a unanimous summit decision on what is clearly a decolonization question? How could anyone expect any Member of the United Nations to say that the United Nations should not even consider a colonial question? How can anyone question the competence of the United Nations to consider this Batter? Who aiaong us is prepared to take the floor and express a lack of confidence in the fairness and objectivity of the decolonization process that we ourselves have established and that we ourselves monitor? Vanuatu would never ask any nation to do anything that is so patently at odds with its own principles and the Charter. we hope that France, the administering Power in New Caledonia, would not consider asking any nation to do such a thing.\nPrance is still our friend, its representatives and its nationals are in all sincerity welcome in Vanuatu. We anticipate that they will also be welcome in an independent New Caledonia. We fully understand the political constraints and other difficulties facing France in New Caledonia due to the presence of a large settler population. It has faced similar constraints before, as have other administering Powers.\nThe independence movement and the countries of the region are anxious to work constructively with the French Government in the decolonization process. That is why we wish to have the United Nations play its customary role. What could be more reasonable?\nIndonesia, our large and influential neighbor, is a country we respect. We have always admired its struggle to free itself from colonialism. Everyone knows that we have also on occasion disagreed with some of its policies in our area. Despite these areas of disagreement, Vanuatu has always considered itself a friend of Indonesia and always will.\nOn roost matters we concur. On a few we do not. However, we listen attentively to Indonesia's position on those subjects. We analyze what is said and carefully note the areas in which, as a matter of principle, we do not agree and those in which we do agree.\nNothing is static. Only evolution is a constant. We have never feared to let Indonesia know where we have disagreed. Similarly, we do not fear to let it know where we* agree. We do so today once again as a candid friend.\nWe are pleased by the ability of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to address some of the problems that have arisen along their border in a positive and conciliatory manner. As a Melanesian State sharing a rich cultural heritage with other Melanesian peoples, Vanuatu appreciates the measures taken to assure the survival of cultural diversity and ethnic pluralism in our region. We commend Indonesia and Papua New Guinea for the steps they have taken in this regard. Both deserve a great deal of credit and support for these initiatives and those to follow.\nOn East Timor, we support the Secretary-General's attempts to bring about an acceptable solution. His humanitarian efforts merit the support of the entire international community. The negotiations between Portugal and Indonesia are an encouraging sign. As we have always stated, we will support the genuine wishes of the people of the Territory, nothing more and nothing less.\nR Ours is a monumental task. The United Nations is charged with considering and resolving major issues some of which seem in one form or another to have vexed mankind almost from the beginning of recorded history. There are still no easy answers or quick solutions to any of these issues.\nJust as nature's process of creating oil or precious minerals took centuries of agitation and ferment of various elements, so too will the process of creating a better future take years of effort by every nation represented in this Hall, and\nr-\nsome that are not yet represented here. We have begun that process. Let us continue it, and let us bequeath to future generations' the ability and the means to improve upon the humble efforts of this generation. .\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "VUT_41_1986", "year": 1986}, "spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 141, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 23, "token_end": 27}, {"start": 2922, "end": 2934, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 577, "token_end": 579}, {"start": 3023, "end": 3032, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 597, "token_end": 598}, {"start": 3165, "end": 3169, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 624, "token_end": 625}, {"start": 3174, "end": 3178, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 626, "token_end": 627}, {"start": 3183, "end": 3190, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 629, "token_end": 630}, {"start": 3357, "end": 3363, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 660, "token_end": 661}, {"start": 3454, "end": 3467, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 678, "token_end": 680}, {"start": 3770, "end": 3776, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 736, "token_end": 737}, {"start": 3901, "end": 3910, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 767, "token_end": 768}, {"start": 3915, "end": 3926, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 769, "token_end": 770}, {"start": 4289, "end": 4303, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 845, "token_end": 847}, {"start": 4341, "end": 4353, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 856, "token_end": 858}, {"start": 4403, "end": 4410, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 867, "token_end": 868}, {"start": 4545, "end": 4552, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 892, "token_end": 893}, {"start": 4711, "end": 4721, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 928, "token_end": 929}, {"start": 7161, "end": 7167, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1390, "token_end": 1391}, {"start": 7196, "end": 7208, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1398, "token_end": 1399}, {"start": 7295, "end": 7307, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1417, "token_end": 1419}, {"start": 7313, "end": 7320, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1421, "token_end": 1422}, {"start": 9921, "end": 9938, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1915, "token_end": 1918}, {"start": 9943, "end": 9959, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1919, "token_end": 1922}, {"start": 11158, "end": 11167, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2127, "token_end": 2128}, {"start": 13217, "end": 13229, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2528, "token_end": 2530}, {"start": 13417, "end": 13431, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2564, "token_end": 2567}, {"start": 13664, "end": 13676, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2614, "token_end": 2616}, {"start": 13946, "end": 13960, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2667, "token_end": 2670}, {"start": 14022, "end": 14035, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2682, "token_end": 2684}, {"start": 14420, "end": 14432, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2754, "token_end": 2756}, {"start": 14484, "end": 14491, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2767, "token_end": 2768}, {"start": 15241, "end": 15255, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2913, "token_end": 2916}, {"start": 17276, "end": 17284, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3298, "token_end": 3299}, {"start": 18714, "end": 18723, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3580, "token_end": 3581}, {"start": 18765, "end": 18772, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3592, "token_end": 3593}, {"start": 19962, "end": 19971, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3835, "token_end": 3836}, {"start": 22281, "end": 22290, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4264, "token_end": 4265}, {"start": 22602, "end": 22611, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4322, "token_end": 4323}, {"start": 22711, "end": 22720, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4347, "token_end": 4348}, {"start": 22965, "end": 22974, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4402, "token_end": 4403}, {"start": 23142, "end": 23151, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4443, "token_end": 4444}, {"start": 23346, "end": 23356, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4478, "token_end": 4479}, {"start": 23497, "end": 23506, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4502, "token_end": 4503}, {"start": 23870, "end": 23878, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4569, "token_end": 4570}, {"start": 23883, "end": 23892, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 4571, "token_end": 4572}]}
{"text": "I \nsincerely congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir \nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election to the post of \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth \nsession. I am convinced that his considerable \nexperience will contribute to the achievement of \nsignificant results on behalf of States Members of the \nUnited Nations and the entire Organization. \n This year, the great family of States Members of the \nUnited Nations was enriched by a new 193rd Member. On \nbehalf of Ukraine, I would like to express our support \nfor the Government and people of South Sudan in the \nprocess of State-building, and to assure them of \nUkraine\u2019s readiness to develop equal and mutually \nbeneficial cooperation with a new member of the \ninternational community. \n This is a special session given the number of high-\nlevel meetings devoted to issues of a global scale \u2014 \nnuclear safety and security, the prevention of \nnon-communicable diseases, desertification and land \ndegradation, racism and discrimination. \n During this session, the delegation of Ukraine has \nactively participated in discussions on the issues that \nare most topical for our State \u2014 nuclear security and \ndisease control. With regard to the theme of the general \ndebate, \u201cThe role of mediation in the settlement of \ndisputes\u201d, I note that the issue of preventing armed \nconflict, and the loss of human lives and the suffering \ntriggered by them, was one of the cornerstones of \nUkraine\u2019s first membership, as an independent State, of \nthe Security Council in 2000-2001. \n Preventive diplomacy and mediation at the \nregional and international levels, from the frozen \nconflicts in the post-Soviet space to a peaceful \nsettlement in the Middle East and the restoration of \nstability in North Africa, remain an integral part of \nUkraine\u2019s foreign policy. We pursue that policy in the \nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Commission, and will \ncontinue to do so during Ukraine\u2019s presidency of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in \n2013. \n Regrettably, conflict prevention efforts are often \nnot effective enough, and conflict settlement takes too \nlong. Our main duty in such cases is to save lives and \nto alleviate the fate of civilians who find themselves in \ndanger. Ukraine will always provide help to those who \nsuffer. In addition to humanitarian efforts, we are ready \nto support all constructive international peace \ninitiatives and preventive measures. \n We believe that, in armed confrontations, top \npriority must be given to respect for human rights, first \nof all by ensuring the safety of civilians. Guided by \nthis principle, Ukraine was among the first to carry out \na humanitarian mission in Libya at the beginning of \nthis year. The Ukrainian amphibious landing ship \nKonstantin Olshansky was used to evacuate almost \n200 citizens of 20 nationalities, more than half of them \nwomen and children, from the conflict zone. \n Ukraine has just celebrated the twentieth \nanniversary of its independence. Today, we are \nassessing the road we have travelled and rethinking \nsome important moments in our modern history in \norder to find effective solutions to the issues that have \nremained unresolved for many years. It is precisely for \nthat purpose that I have initiated sweeping reforms in \nthe country, aimed at social and economic \ntransformations and at further strengthening the \ndemocratic system and the rule of law in Ukraine.  \n The foundations of all reform processes in \nUkraine are the fundamental democratic values that \nUkrainians share with other Europeans. That is why the \nguiding principles we have determined for the \nmodernization of the country are directly related to the \nambitious objectives contained in the future \nAssociation Agreement between Ukraine and the \nEuropean Union. \n The twentieth anniversary of our independence is \nonly an instant in historical terms, yet the roots of our \nstatehood can be traced back thousands of years. Since \nancient times, Ukraine has been developing a European \nspirit and culture, while cherishing the traditions of \ntolerance and inter-ethnic and intercultural harmony in \n \n \n5 11-50702 \n \nour society. We believe that straightforward and frank \ndialogue based on universal values is the only way to \nfind a common language in each country and in \ninternational relations alike. \n Ukraine\u2019s position on the need to uphold human \nrights at all times and everywhere as the highest value \nhas always been crystal clear. Examples of that \ncommitment are seen in Ukraine\u2019s activities during its \ntwo terms of membership in the Human Rights Council \nfrom June 2006 to June 2011. We will not lessen our \nattention to this subject and are planning to rejoin the \nCouncil in 2018. \n As Chair of the Committee of Ministers of the \nCouncil of Europe from May to November this year, \nUkraine is focused on the issues of children\u2019s rights, \nthe development of local self-governance and the rule \nof law. We are convinced that the rule of law and \nrespect for human rights, as the bases for building a \nsociety, are needed to counter many contemporary \nthreats, including the complex challenges of terrorism. \n Recently, the world shuddered from the attack on \nthe United Nations building in Nigeria, which offered \nyet further proof that the ugly face of terrorism is \nbecoming more repulsive and brazen. The blow was \nstruck directly against our Organization, which is of \nparticular concern and requires increased security for \nUnited Nations premises. \n As one of the State initiators of the Convention \non the Safety of United Nations and Associated \nPersonnel, and as a party to all universal anti-terrorist \nconventions currently in force, Ukraine resolutely \ncondemns any manifestations of terrorism. We believe \nthat all terrorist acts, regardless of who commits them \nand where or why they are committed, violate a \nfundamental human right \u2014 the right to life \u2014 and \ntherefore constitute a crime against humanity. I pay \ntribute to the memory of those killed 10 years ago, on \n11 September 2001, as well as to all other victims of \nterrorist attacks. \n I am sincerely proud of the significant \ncontribution of Ukraine to the peaceful coexistence of \nhumankind. I refer not only to our voluntarily \nabandoning nuclear arms and large stockpiles of highly \nenriched uranium. The awareness of the global scale of \nthe effects of the Chernobyl disaster was the impetus \nfor my initiative to convene the Kyiv Summit on the \nSafe and Innovative Use of Nuclear Energy in April. \nThe Summit enabled us to enhance international \ncooperation in strengthening nuclear safety and in \nresponding adequately to accidents and emergencies. I \nsincerely thank all the participants in the Kyiv Summit \nand all of the donor countries that announced their \ncontributions to Chernobyl projects. \n We also welcome the holding of the high-level \nmeeting on nuclear safety and security, scheduled for \ntomorrow. We are committed to jointly working further \non this issue. Our country has unique experience in the \nrehabilitation of the area and the population victimized \nby the Chernobyl disaster. We are ready to share this \nexperience. Ukraine consistently supports efforts to \nensure gradual and irreversible nuclear disarmament \nfor the purpose of completely eliminating nuclear \nweapons from the world. We continue to insist that \nsecurity assurances for non-nuclear and non-aligned \nStates should be enshrined in a legally binding \ninternational instrument. I urge the leaders of other \nStates to consciously follow the example of Ukraine \nand its practical actions to promote disarmament and \nnon-proliferation. \n Ukraine is actively participating in United \nNations efforts to maintain international peace and \nsecurity. Throughout its 20 years of independence, over \n34,000 Ukraine\u2019s soldiers and police have taken part in \npeacekeeping missions in more than 20 operations \nunder the United Nations mandate. Ukraine is a \ndedicated supporter of United Nations peacekeeping \nreform, the goal of which is to strengthen the \nOrganization\u2019s capacity and eliminate existing \nshortcomings. Utmost attention should be paid to \nensuring the mobility of aviation resources in United \nNations peacekeeping, as well as to enhancing legal \nprotection for Blue Helmets. We are grateful to \nMember States for their support of Ukraine\u2019s initiatives \nin this area, and we hope for effective joint work to be \nundertaken in this direction. \n One year ago, we held a High-level Plenary \nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals. \nUkraine is committed to its obligations in achieving \nnational development goals. Among our main priorities \nare poverty reduction, ensuring quality education, \nenvironmental protection, improving health and \nreducing child mortality, curbing the spread of \nHIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and ensuring gender \nequality.  \n Working on today\u2019s immediate tasks, we believe \nit is necessary to pay greater attention to the \n  \n \n11-50702 6 \n \nincreasingly acute issue of climate change and \nenvironmental protection. We endorse the idea of \ncreating an effective international mechanism for the \nenvironmental protection of Earth as our common \nplanet \u2014 a global environmental organization with \nuniversal membership functioning on a permanent \nbasis. We also call upon Member States to study the \nidea of developing a new universal instrument that \ncould serve as a so-called environmental constitution, \ngive all countries clear guidelines from the cultural \nperspective, and identify compulsory principles for the \nsustainable development of the global green economy \nand the environmental safety of the planet. \n We consider it necessary to work on improving \nglobal energy security. We encourage the development, \nunder United Nations coordination, of an effective \nmultilateral cooperation mechanism aimed at achieving \ndevelopment goals in the energy field. \n In overcoming the impact of the global economic \ncrisis, we must avoid new challenges to the financial \nsector that affect trade and investment. It is our belief \nthat economic and social development should be \nfacilitated by the further liberalization of trade. \n In recent years, we have come to see how \nvulnerable any one nation can be to various security \nthreats and natural or manmade disasters. All these \nexamples have shown us the need for effective \ninternational mechanisms for combating such \nphenomena. It is high time that the United Nations and \nits specialized agencies seriously strengthened their \nrole in coordinating international efforts aimed at \npreventing, responding to and overcoming the impacts \nof catastrophes and severe humanitarian crises. We \nlook forward to strengthening the specialized United \nNations agencies and improving their effectiveness. \nUkraine stands ready to continue its active involvement \nin the practical humanitarian efforts of the World Food \nProgramme. A few days ago, Ukraine decided to \nprovide, through the United Nations, humanitarian \nassistance in the form of wheat for the purpose of \ncombating hunger in the Horn of Africa. \n Ukraine supports the greater involvement of the \nGeneral Assembly in international life and \nstrengthening its voice in addressing a wide range of \nglobal issues. The modern world is presenting the \nUnited Nations with new, complex and increasingly \ndifficult issues. We will not be able to improve the \neffectiveness of our joint work, however, without \ncomprehensive reform of the Organization and its \nprincipal bodies, including the Security Council.  \n Ukraine is open to discussing all progressive \nconcepts of reform that can bring Member States to the \nbroadest possible agreement. The consideration of the \ninterests of every regional group is an indispensable \ncomponent of the process of reforming the Council. \nUkraine believes that at least one additional \nnon-permanent seat of an expanded Security Council \nshould be given to the Group of Eastern European \nStates. \n I am confident that the sixty-sixth session of the \nGeneral Assembly will strengthen the United Nations \nin the face of global challenges and threats, reliably \nguaranteed by our strong political commitment and a \nclear vision of our common goals. I believe in our \nshared success.", "meta": {"doc_id": "UKR_66_2011", "year": 2011}, "spans": [{"start": 556, "end": 567, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 109, "token_end": 111}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1446, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 284, "token_end": 285}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1794, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 353, "token_end": 354}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2251, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 441, "token_end": 442}, {"start": 2615, "end": 2622, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 512, "token_end": 513}, {"start": 2683, "end": 2688, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 525, "token_end": 526}, {"start": 2725, "end": 2734, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 535, "token_end": 536}, {"start": 3758, "end": 3765, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 719, "token_end": 720}, {"start": 4335, "end": 4342, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 830, "token_end": 831}, {"start": 5232, "end": 5239, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1013, "token_end": 1014}, {"start": 6477, "end": 6487, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1254, "token_end": 1255}, {"start": 10933, "end": 10940, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2054, "token_end": 2055}]}
