{"text": "Kindly accept my \ncongratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \nMy delegation assures you of its full cooperation as we \naddress issues identified in the annual report of the \nSecretary-General (A/62/1) and as we responsibly and \ncreatively move forward with pending reforms of the \nOrganization. \n At the outset I would like to express India\u2019s deep \ngratitude to all Member States for the recent \nunanimous adoption by the General Assembly of \nresolution 61/271, deciding to annually observe the \nInternational Day of Non-Violence, on 2 October, the \nanniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. I also \nlook forward to participation by Member States in the \ninformal plenary meeting of the General Assembly and \nother functions being organized tomorrow at the United \nNations to mark the first International Day of \nNon-Violence. \nA central topic for this year\u2019s debate   \nresponding to climate change   is both timely and \nrelevant. India\u2019s views on it were recently set forth at \nthe high-level event on climate change, which took \nplace here on 24 September. Combined with the \nexchange of views in the general debate, it will no \ndoubt provide a useful backdrop to the meeting of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange to be held later this year in Bali, Indonesia.  \n The impact of climate change and environmental \ndegradation falls disproportionately upon developing \ncountries. Developing countries are the most \nvulnerable to it, and also lack the means to tackle it. \nMeasures to address climate change must be based on \nmitigation and adaptation strategies with fair burden-\nsharing and measures to realize sustainable patterns of \nconsumption and production. The process of burden-\nsharing must also take into account where the primary \nresponsibility for the present state of greenhouse gas \nconcentration in the atmosphere rests and not foreclose \nrapid and sustained economic development for the \ndeveloping world, which, in any case, is an imperative \nfor adaptation. \n Technology is the other key area that needs to be \naddressed. It is important that critical clean \ntechnologies be made available and affordable to \ndeveloping countries. The intellectual property rights \nregime must balance rewards for innovators with the \ncommon good of humankind. Concerted international \naction to address climate change, in accordance with \nthe principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as \nnational circumstances and social and economic \nconditions, is the need of the hour. India, for which \nenergy security is a national imperative, has a very \nsmall individual carbon footprint, with per capita \ncarbon dioxide emissions at just about a quarter of the \nworld\u2019s average. Even so, we are determined that, as \nwe pursue economic growth, our per capita greenhouse \ngas emissions will not increase beyond those of the \nindustrial countries. \n Poverty and underdevelopment are amongst the \ncentral challenges of our times. The overarching \nrequirement is for sustained economic growth to \neradicate poverty in developing countries. However, \neconomic growth must also be measured against the \ntemplate of social inclusion. Growth alone is not \nenough if it does not produce benefits that are \nsufficiently dispersed, not only in terms of increased \nincome and employment, but also for improved health, \nnutrition and education for all. \n I affirm India\u2019s resolve to achieve the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Government \nof India accords the highest priority to inclusive \ngrowth, including the political, legal, educational and \neconomic empowerment of women, effective and \naffordable public health, and enhanced access to \neducational opportunities, especially for all those who \nare disadvantaged. \n It is apparent that progress in the achievement of \nthe internationally agreed development goals has been \ntardy. The international community, through the United \nNations system, must more effectively support the \nefforts of developing countries to achieve the \ndevelopment goals. A comprehensive reform of the \ninternational financial architecture is a key ingredient \nin that process. The United Nations must play an \nimportant role in overseeing the reform of the \ninternational financial architecture. That should include \nmeasures to ensure a greater voice for and participation \nby developing countries in the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions. The process of reform must be carried to \nits logical conclusion if the credibility of those \ninstitutions is to be enhanced. \n We must also address as a priority the regrettable \ninversion of global resource flows. Today, instead of \nthe urgently needed inflow of resources to developing \ncountries to buttress their national economic \ndevelopment plans, we are confronted with a net \noutflow from them. Official development assistance \n(ODA) showed a marked fall during 2006 and remains \nwell below the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \nproduct. It is primarily being used to finance debt \nrelief. That this is happening after so many years of \nliberalization and globalization highlights our \ncollective failure. Perhaps we should be considering \nmechanisms, such as an international debt commission, \nto redress the problem of developing country debt.  \n The least developed countries, which are \nparticularly hard hit by rising energy costs, find \nthemselves in an even more difficult situation. \nEnhanced and predictable resource flow to developing \ncountries remains a key objective of the global \npartnership for development. India will continue to do \nwhat it can to help with capacity-building in other \ndeveloping countries and to assist them through ODA \nwithin the limits of its capacity. By the end of the year, \nimports from least developed countries into India will \nface a zero-tariff regime. \n Early and substantive progress at the Doha Round \nof trade negotiations, based on the primacy of the \ndevelopment dimension, is another imperative. We \nmust return to the negotiating table with a redoubled \nsense of urgency, while recognizing that adherence to \nthe existing mandate remains critical. Nor can the \ninterests of subsistence farmers be ignored or equated \nwith those of other sectors. An illogical linkage \nbetween agriculture and non-agricultural market access \nwill only complicate the development impact of the \nRound. The overarching principle of special and \ndifferential treatment for developing countries remains \na categorical imperative. \n As part of India's commitment to the \nachievement of human rights for all, and as a member \nof the Human Rights Council, we remain actively \ninvolved in developing the institutional framework of \nthat body, including the universal periodic review \nmechanism, based on effective international \ncooperation as a central principle in the Council\u2019s \nmethods of work. India will work towards developing \nan international normative framework for the \npromotion and protection of human rights. India is \nhonoured to be one of the first signatories of the \nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \nPersons from Enforced Disappearance. Earlier today, I \nalso had the honour of depositing India\u2019s instrument of \nratification of the United Nations Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities.  \n As the largest democracy in the world, India has \ndeveloped a system of local self-government with \ndemocratically elected institutions of representative \nGovernment at all levels   the village, the district, the \nState and the nation. The effort to make participatory \ndemocracy more meaningful to every Indian citizen \nunderpins what is perhaps one of the greatest social \nexperiments in the world today, namely, the transfer of \ndecision-making power to nearly one million elected \nwomen local Government representatives. As a result, \nwomen are not merely the beneficiaries of change in \nIndia, but are its instruments. \n As the world\u2019s largest democracy, it was also \nnatural for India to support the establishment of the \nUnited Nations Democracy Fund. We made an initial \ncontribution of $10 million to the Fund and remain \nactively and constructively involved in realizing the \nobjectives for which it was set up. As a small token of \nour commitment to that laudable initiative, I have the \nprivilege of announcing a further pledge of $10 million \nto the United Nations Democracy Fund. \n The international system cannot be reordered \nmeaningfully without a comprehensive reform of the \nUnited Nations. If the Organization is to remain the \ncornerstone of the international architecture in this \ncentury, it cannot remain mired in the realities of the \n1940s. Despite substantive implementation of the \nUnited Nations reform agenda that emerged from the \n2005 World Summit Outcome, such reform will \ninevitably remain incomplete without comprehensive \nreform and expansion of the Security Council and \nrevitalization of the General Assembly. Elements and \nideas on the reform of the Security Council have been \ndiscussed for well over a decade in numerous reports \nand interminable consultations. It is now time for \nintergovernmental negotiations to commence in order \nto make the Security Council more democratic, \nrepresentative and responsive.  \n We, together with partners from Africa, Latin \nAmerica and Asia, tabled a resolution on 11 September \n2007, spelling out the principles on which reform \nought to be based if it is to be meaningful. These \nprinciples are expansion in both permanent and \nnon-permanent categories of membership; greater \nrepresentation for developing countries and \nrepresentation for developed countries that is reflective \nof contemporary world realities; and comprehensive \nimprovement in the working methods of the Security \nCouncil, including ensuring greater access for island \nand small States. We welcome recent statements from \nthis podium by President Bush of the United States of \nAmerica and other world leaders on the need for \nSecurity Council reform in both the permanent and \nnon-permanent categories. It is high time that we \ncollectively bring these ideas to implementation. \n Reform of the United Nations would also be \nincomplete without revitalization of the General \nAssembly. The central goal of such revitalization must \nbe the restoration and enhancement of the role and \nauthority of the General Assembly as originally \nenvisaged in the Charter. \n Given the significance of developmental \nactivities for the developing world, India sees a \ncorresponding need for the reform of United Nations \noperational activities in favour of development. Since \nthese activities are aimed at supporting the work of \nMember States, it follows that Members must \ndetermine their direction and shape through an \nintergovernmental process. The litmus test for any \nreform proposal is whether it improves the support \nextended by the United Nations to the efforts of \nprogramme countries. India would therefore judge \nreform proposals by their impact on the ground, by the \nresultant improvement in the effectiveness of the \nsystem and by the impact on transaction costs for the \nUnited Nations development system. \n Steps to achieve the complete elimination of \nnuclear weapons have also only made limited headway. \nDespite some progress, the world remains far from \nachieving the objective of total elimination of nuclear \nweapons. India\u2019s long-standing commitment to \nuniversal, non-discriminatory and comprehensive \nnuclear disarmament is embodied in the vision of late \nPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for a nuclear-free and \nnon-violent world. This vision was put forward nearly \ntwo decades ago. It remains undiminished today.  \n Indeed, it is all the more relevant today, given the \nfact that peaceful uses of nuclear energy can address \nthe inexorably growing demand for new and  \nnon-polluting sources of energy to fuel economic \ndevelopment. We will be bringing proposals to \nMember States and this Organization to see how we \ncan refocus on general and complete disarmament, \nparticularly nuclear disarmament. Disarmament is our \nagreed goal, and it subsumes arms control and \nnon-proliferation. \n It is well known that India has an impeccable \nrecord in preventing the proliferation of sensitive \ntechnologies. That is in keeping with our commitment \nto being a responsible nuclear Power. India is ready to \nwork with the international community to develop a \nnew international consensus on non-proliferation. The \ninternational community needs to intensify the effort to \naddress the very real threat posed by the link between \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n(WMDs) and related materials and technologies and \nthe ability of non-State actors to acquire them. The risk \nposed by the intersection between proliferation and \nterrorism is real and serious. The central objective must \nbe to ensure that our solidarity in words is translated \ninto action. \n The adoption of the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy last September was a \nnoteworthy development, signalling the will of the \ninternational community to combat this menace in a \nholistic and coordinated manner. Welcome as the \nStrategy is, there is much more that needs to be done to \ncombat the menace that international terrorism has \nbecome. India is convinced that without the early \nadoption of a comprehensive convention against \ninternational terrorism, the global struggle against \nterrorism remains incomplete and likely to succeed \nonly partially. We must ensure that there is zero \ntolerance for all forms of terrorism. \n In conclusion, I would express the hope that our \ndeliberations in the year ahead will lead us to \nenlightened action. With maturity and resolve we will \nsuccessfully overcome the many challenges before us. \n", "meta": {"doc_id": "IND_62_2007", "year": 2007}, "spans": [{"start": 403, "end": 408, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 80, "token_end": 81}, {"start": 710, "end": 716, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 140, "token_end": 141}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1006, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 197, "token_end": 198}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1345, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 268, "token_end": 269}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1356, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 270, "token_end": 271}, {"start": 2624, "end": 2629, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 493, "token_end": 494}, {"start": 3493, "end": 3498, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 659, "token_end": 660}, {"start": 3631, "end": 3636, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 682, "token_end": 683}, {"start": 4527, "end": 4540, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 836, "token_end": 838}, {"start": 5698, "end": 5703, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1051, "token_end": 1052}, {"start": 5935, "end": 5940, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1099, "token_end": 1100}, {"start": 6650, "end": 6655, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1230, "token_end": 1231}, {"start": 7002, "end": 7007, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1296, "token_end": 1297}, {"start": 7126, "end": 7131, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1316, "token_end": 1317}, {"start": 7329, "end": 7334, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1354, "token_end": 1355}, {"start": 7485, "end": 7490, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1383, "token_end": 1384}, {"start": 8038, "end": 8043, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1486, "token_end": 1487}, {"start": 8131, "end": 8136, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1507, "token_end": 1508}, {"start": 9451, "end": 9458, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1748, "token_end": 1749}, {"start": 9979, "end": 9985, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1841, "token_end": 1842}, {"start": 10055, "end": 10072, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1855, "token_end": 1858}, {"start": 10077, "end": 10084, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1860, "token_end": 1861}, {"start": 10637, "end": 10642, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1961, "token_end": 1962}, {"start": 11082, "end": 11087, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2041, "token_end": 2042}, {"start": 11527, "end": 11532, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2122, "token_end": 2123}, {"start": 12083, "end": 12089, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2232, "token_end": 2233}, {"start": 12321, "end": 12326, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2278, "token_end": 2279}, {"start": 12491, "end": 12496, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2308, "token_end": 2309}, {"start": 13438, "end": 13443, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2486, "token_end": 2487}]}
{"text": "\ufeffMr. President, let me first fulfil a pleasant duty on behalf of myself and the delegation of Grenada. We congratulate you, Sir, on your election to your high office. Your distinguished record of achievement highly qualifies you to guide the deliberations of this body and we are confident that in that office you will make a great contribution to the success of this thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\n2.\tWe express our gratitude to your predecessor, Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim. We are grateful to him and his country for his services. They are well noted, and cannot be forgotten.\n3.\tWe offer our special thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, for his untiring efforts in the furtherance of the objectives of the United Nations.\n4.\tSubscribing to the principle of universality of member-ship of the United Nations, Grenada welcomes the admission of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Zimbabwe to this Organization. We are happy to welcome Saint Vincent not only because, like Grenada, it is a member of the Caribbean community but particularly because it is our closest neighbour and shares with us ties of history, geography, culture and blood.\n5.\tWe particularly welcome Zimbabwe because of its heroic and historic struggle for freedom and independence. Zimbabwe has enjoyed our deep respect, admiration and firm support throughout the most difficult and trying period of its valiant and successful confrontation with racism and imperialism. Zimbabwe is the most recent testimony to the scientific fact that a united people fighting for freedom and social justice will always be victorious. We join the nations of the world in making a strong appeal for financial aid to help in the national reconstruction of Zimbabwe. Each new nation will inevitably seek its own route to development, and certainly each of us has a fundamental responsibility to respect, deal with and maintain normal State-to-State relations with each other regardless of the ideological predisposition of the various State systems.\n6.\tWe in Grenada are revolutionaries; we are not dogmatists. We understand that change is a process requiring the scientific development of the objective and subjective factors. We favour the movement towards anti-imperialism, but we know, purely on the basis of scientific objectivity, that change cannot be achieved at one stroke. So, while we reserve the right to maintain the most cordial relations with political parties and States which share our ideological pre-dispositions, we regard it as a serious and historic obligation to maintain and build normal State-to-State relations. Even so, we will always unhesitatingly denounce the development of Fascist tendencies and the murder of revolutionaries wherever they occur. We have resolutely denounced the Chilean Fascist regime and we have publicly supported, and will continue to support, those who seek to restore democracy to Chile. We will take the same position wherever else fascism rears its ugly head.\n7.\tThe pursuit of democratic progressive and anti- imperialist goals in Grenada requires of us a commitment to support the right of all peoples to be free and independent and to choose their direction on the basis of that reality. It is for this reason that we support the right to independence of all colonial territories in the Caribbean and elsewhere. Belize is of special concern. There are no barriers to the independence of that nation except the absurd claim by reactionary circles in Guatemala that Guatemala has a legal right to more than 75 per cent of the territory of that nation. That claim is repudiated by the vast majority of the people of Guatemala. There is no doubt that the reactionary elements in Guatemala could sustain that claim only with the support of imperialist interests. And now that the revolution is taking hold in Central America, they and their imperialist allies are increasingly reluctant to agree to the unconditional sovereignty of the people of Belize.\n8.\tWe States Members of the United Nations must take an international initiative to ensure the immediate and guaranteed independence of Belize. The ritual mentioning of our support for Belize in international forums is not enough. In collaboration with the people of Belize, we must set a date for independence and ensure the early decolonization of that Territory. Put it to the conscience of the world as it has never been put before: Belize must be free because the reality is that none of us is free until all of us are free. This is most evident in the Caribbean community, where the colonial Powers constantly claim the right to intervene on behalf of their colonies and in the process undermine the sovereignty of each of us.\u2003\n9.\tIt is our very firm view that lack of self-determination is the primary contradiction, the first item on the agenda for any colonial country. Until that question is resolved, no other matter affecting the external relations of such States should be settled.\n10.\tIt is the right of the people of Puerto Rico to achieve their independence. Let them have that right, and afterwards, if they so wish, they can look to the question of working out special relationships with other countries.\n11.\tAs far as the British colonies are concerned, there appears to be a fair prospect of their achieving independence within a reasonable time. However, there are colonies in our region, and the position of our Government remains firm, that independence is the right of all the peoples demanding it. That position cannot be compromised, particularly in relation to the Latin American-Caribbean region, which remains\u2014and we say this with great indignation\u2014the most colonized region in the world today.\n12.\tThe independence that we seek for our brother nations must be equal in all measures to the independence that we seek for ourselves. Like the vast majority of Members of the United Nations, we are convinced that the people of all territories which are not independent have the inalienable right to self-determination, independence and territorial integrity. We are convinced, too, that all nations have the inalienable right to exercise national sovereignty and to the absolute control of their wealth and natural resources, so as to be able to contribute to the development of their territories and the well-being of their inhabitants. And all of us must be prepared to assist in defending that right and to struggle against any attempts at destabilization and intervention. In our short experience of revolutionary transformation we have experienced varying forms of both.\n13.\tFrom the very beginning we have faced the threat of military intervention from mercenaries who serve the cause of imperialism. Very early in our revolution we faced what might be called a diplomatic-economic intervention, when imperialist interests again threatened to ruin our tourist industry unless we abided by their dictates. Soon after, we had the experience of violent intervention, when local counter-revolutionary elements in alliance with Mafia and imperialist agents vainly sought to turn back our revolution by overt and covert intervention.\n14.\tThe imperialist rumour machine has been working overtime to discredit our efforts at economic, political and social reconstruction. We know, of course, that we are not the only object of imperialist attention. We have seen them try to belittle the Iranian revolution, to discredit the Cuban and Nicaraguan revolutions, to undermine the Kampuchean revolution, the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic, Palestine, Namibia, Ethiopia and Angola, to name just a few. Sadly, this is only an early stage in the plans of imperialism to turn back the tide of revolution. For the pattern has been that when all those plans have failed, those same interventionist forces seek to assassinate the revolutionary leadership. We have experienced their wrath in the savage attack of 19 June, in which three young women were killed and 94 people wounded by a bomb manufactured under licence from imperialism. Those murderous plans of imperialism and its local counter-revolutionary agents and terrorists to wipe out at one blow the revolutionary leadership in our country failed.\n15.\tWe in Grenada know that this will not stop now. We know that those elements will continue in their blind ambitions to reverse the will of the people. And we live by the dictum \"hat those who make a revolution must be prepared to defend it.\n16.\tThe fact is that the vast majority of us who seek to introduce fundamental change have already faced such experiences and all of us are capable of facing them. None of us, however, can dare to condone any of these interventionist techniques. Indeed, we feel sure that we shall all condemn them as flagrant violations of the sovereign right of each nation to self-determination and independent development.\n17.\tWe regret the outbreak of hostilities between Iran and Iraq. Both societies are fuelled by a revolutionary dynamic that is fundamentally anti-imperialist, although each takes a different course. That reality was strikingly illustrated by the fact that, after the hated Shah was deposed, Iraq sponsored Iran for membership in the non-aligned movement. The achievement of a just and lasting peace, which ensures respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, is therefore our most fervent desire.\n18.\tThe past year has witnessed a great increase in Zionist arrogance, insults, insolence and racist oppression. Not only have the Zionists refused to abide by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), not only have they refused to return the Palestinian lands illegally acquired in 1967, not only have they refused to bow to the demands of world public opinion but, even more, they have illegally acquired the whole of Jerusalem and they have sanctioned the murder, maiming, torture and general violation of the human rights of the people of Palestine.\n19.\tWe shall continue to support the right of the people of Palestine to their homeland. Grenada will always support the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the sole and authentic representative of the heroic Palestinian people and we are prepared to make whatever contribution we can to the just settlement of the problem of Israeli encroachment.\n20.\tThat pattern of encroachment is being followed by other racist States. In particular, South Africa, which daily brutalizes our black brothers and sisters using the cruel whip of apartheid, has taken to invading Angola and Mozambique in what it arrogantly describes as punitive raids. It is fanning the flames of a war that threatens to be genocidal in its dimensions. It would be most sensible of South Africa immediately to halt its external aggression and its internal repression, to take to heart the experiences of Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Kenya and others and to initiate a system of majority rule before the passions of racism drive the oppressed blacks of South Africa to a more painful and harrowing solution that will set the world on edge for generations to come.\n21.\tSouth Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and its stubborn refusal to heed the advice of even its staunchest allies demonstrate the irrationality of fascism at work. The South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] has been internationally recognized as the only legitimate representative of the people of Namibia and no amount of imperialist or Fascist manoeuvring can change that fact. A people united in armed struggle cannot be defeated.\n22.\tThat dictum applies equally to the valiant and heroic people of El Salvador, where a military junta supported by the local oligarchy and imperialism has been engaged in a genocidal war, in the mistaken belief that they can defeat the people.\n23.\tWith imperialist military and financial support, the final day of victory will be delayed but the people can never be defeated. In this forum we wish to declare our support for all our Latin American and Caribbean neighbours struggling for freedom and independence, including the people of Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Haiti.\n24.\tThe Fascist military coup in Bolivia is totally intolerable. Whatever the extent of the present repression, whatever the price of freedom, the people of Bolivia\u2014the inheritors of the name of the great liberator, Simon Bolivar\u2014will, through their own efforts and with the public moral support of the people of Grenada and all other peace-loving people, gain their freedom.\n25.\tFrom our own experiences and from the lessons of history we know that revolution cannot be forced, created or exported. We know that the objective and subjective factors must merge. Equally, we see each day the balance of forces moving in the direction of revolutionary transformation and we have the fullest confidence that history is on the side of the people because the days of oligarchy, feudalism and fascism are numbered. We continue resolutely to condemn the criminal Pol Pot gang, which murdered millions of Kampucheans. We wish to restate our view that the Pol Pot gang has no right to a place in this Assembly.\n26.\tTurning to Korea, Grenada wishes to restate its position that peace and stability will continue to be unattainable if reunification is not achieved.\n27.\tOn the question of Cyprus, Grenada will follow closely the intercommunal talks held under the aegis of the Secretary-General. It is our hope that progress will be made during these talks with a view to finding a just and durable solution that will guarantee the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Cyprus and respect its policy of non-alignment.\n28.\tGrenada is a non-aligned country, free of any commitment to any military bloc and anxious to live in a world free of the threat of war. That threat of war looms larger and larger as those who control nuclear weapons for oppressive and exploitative purposes and the means to deliver them throughout the world put petty issues of local political import above and beyond the primary issue of world peace. This, in part, in our understanding, is why reactionary forces in the United States of America are refusing to support ratification of SALT II, thus threatening world peace and security. We in the Caribbean do not have these terrible weapons of war in our hands and we do not need them. But if we are to ensure that the Caribbean remains nuclear-free, we must maintain the call for a collective initiative to ensure that the Caribbean region is recognized as a zone of peace.\n29.\tWe call for the support of the United Nations in our attempt to get urgent Latin American and Caribbean action to achieve the following: first, prohibiting the introduction of nuclear weapons into the region; secondly, stopping all aggressive military manoeuvres in the region; thirdly, dis-mantling all foreign military bases that exist in our area; fourthly, ending the colonization of all territories, once and for all; and, fifthly, establishing machinery to deal with all forms of aggression, including assassinations, mercenary invasions, propaganda intervention and diplomatic and economic aggression.\n30.\tThis is a far-reaching initiative that will involve all of us in many problems of definition. But, of course, that is no reason for attempting to avoid the tasks involved. The success of such an initiative would make its mark on generations yet unborn and make a deserving contribution to the attainment of the elusive goal of world peace.\n31.\tThe peace of the world is also seriously threatened by the pauperization of more than half of mankind and the acquisitive enrichment of a segment of the citizens of the industrialized world.\n32.\tWe are on the verge of concluding a reasonable treaty on the law of the sea that will, we hope, make at least a modest contribution to rectifying the dangerous mal-distribution of the world's resources. We support the view that the resources of the seas and oceans should be utilized for the benefit of all the world's peoples. We reject any suggestion that profit-seeking multinational corporations should be allowed free access to the exploitation of these resources. Some mechanisms and institutional arrangements must be implemented to ensure that the interests and basic needs of developing countries are protected. But the piecemeal tack-ling of these urgent problems will not solve the great divisions between North and South. We need a comprehensive new international economic order.\n33.\tIn recent years every single report of the developed economies has stated that the world economic situation is grim. Usually these same reports predict a gloomy future for the developing world. These reports say that development prospects for the world's poorer nations are practically zero.\n34.\tWhen we look at any of the widely used economic indices, what do we find? We find, for example, that poor developing States suffer from much higher rates of inflation. Recent reports indicate that inflation rates in non-oil- producing developing countries averaged 29.4 per cent in 1979 with even higher rates predicted for 1980. The comparable statistics for the advanced industrial States is reported at just under 10 per cent for both years.\n35.\tCertainly a plan of action for structuring the world economy is an absolute necessity. But plans must not remain mere documents. Plans must be implemented. They must be concretized and serious attempts must be made to ensure speedy and successful implementation. And, further, implementation of plans requires genuine commitment on the part of those countries committed to world economic development. But what do we find? We find that in spite of statements of commitment and plans for implementation there has been very little progress towards achieving the goal of a new international economic order. According to the Secretary-General's report, \"in some crucial fields, including money and finance, protection of the purchasing power of developing countries' exports, access to markets, the process of change, if any, is at an early stage\".\n36.\tFor us poor countries, accumulation is a serious issue. As colonies, our ability to accumulate resources in order to create conditions for our development was seriously con-strained. Foreign ownership and control of our key resources and massive transfers of resources to finance development in the advanced countries ensured that possibilities for economic transformation were limited.\n37.\tA paragraph on page 5 of the World Economic Out-look: A Survey by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund of May 1980, offers us cold comfort:\n\"In any case, the availability of resources to support developmental expenditures in the non-oil developing countries will tend to be squeezed in the period ahead. Maintenance of domestic savings will be difficult or impossible in the face of very high rates of increase in consumer prices, and the real value of funds borrowed or received through grants from abroad will be impaired by the rise in import prices. Even if substantially larger nominal amounts can be borrowed, the recent and prospective deterioration in the terms of trade of the non-oil developing countries means that a larger volume of domestic output must be used to obtain a given real inflow of imported goods and services.\"\n38.\tFinance plays a critical role in the development process. For developing countries, external financial assistance is extremely important, but we must remember that economic backwardness cannot be eradicated simply by attracting foreign capital. Historically, foreign monopolies operating in developing countries have extracted and exported large profits. Rather than promote development, transnational corporations have generated conditions for increasing the impoverishment of poor countries.\n39.\tOfficial development assistance or aid to poor countries has been recorded as a dismal failure. The developed countries have failed miserably to achieve a limited aid target of 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product.\n40.\tWe know that developing countries cannot generate economic and social progress for their peoples without funds from outside. It is imperative; however, that there be a radical change in the terms and conditions under which external financing is obtained. Whether funds are from Government-to-Government programmes, international financial institutions or private investment sources, the terms and conditions under which they are granted are extremely important; and we strongly support the view that such funds must be allocated in such a way as to guarantee the economic advancement of the developing world.\n41.\tWe echo the numerous calls being made in various international forums for democratization of \"international\" financial agencies like IMF. Lending conditions and related economic prescriptions emanating from these institutions must be more sensitive to the needs of the world's poor and materially dispossessed.\n42.\tPrimary commodity production continues to be the main source of foreign exchange earnings, employment creation and income generation in the developing world. So far the implementation of policies to strengthen and stabilize primary commodity prices and markets has been limited. Although in operation, the IMF compensatory financing facility requires significant modifications to satisfy the needs of developing countries; for example, use of the IMF facility is based on a country's IMF quota rather than its financial needs or revenue shortfall. The repayment period under the IMF compensatory financing facility is three to five years, whereas the gestation period for primary products in most developing countries is five to seven years, therefore it is our view that the repayment schedule of institutions like the IMF should be extended to a period of not less than 10 years. With this and other international finance issues in mind, we support the Arusha initiative and join the call for a United Nations conference on international money and finance.\n43.\tEconomic co-operation among developing States is an area of great concern to us. As colonies and former colonics they had a particular form of integration in the international division of labour. Historically, this has had negative consequences. While some countries provided the sugar, others provided nutmegs and others still provided cocoa or coffee, in the final analysis all developing States imported the finished products from the head office or colonizing country. We had everything to lose, nothing to gain.\n44.\tIt is precisely because of that historical experience that we support the deepening of \"South-South\" discussions, not as a replacement for North-South dialogue but to strengthen our negotiating position. More specifically, we urge the implementation of the Arusha programme of collective self-reliance.  In this context, we must ensure that genuine .economic co-operation takes place not only in international trade but also, to a greater extent, in production ventures, marketing and transportation arrangements and financial mobilization. All this must be seen as part of a strategy for eliminating dependence on imperialism and participating in a world economy in conditions which would develop rather than under develop our national economies.\n45.\tIn this respect, we welcome the establishment of the joint Venezuela-Mexico oil facility for Latin American and Caribbean countries. This demonstrates a concrete manifestation of South-South co-operation.\n46.\tAs we say this, we reiterate our fundamental concern for the needs of particularly disadvantaged countries. We recognize that such countries cannot create the conditions for economic transformation without significant assistance. We agree with the Brandt report's recommendation that \"there must be immediate intervention to attack the root causes of poverty\u201d and again we call for speedy and meaningful implementation of those policies.\n47.\tWhen our Prime Minister spoke here last year he stressed our desire for \"a new system of international interdependence, based on mutual respect for sovereignty and a collective will to put an end to imperialist machinations designed to disrupt our unity and purpose\". Our peoples want to establish truly equal and mutually beneficial international co-operation. In this sense, therefore, we sup-port proposals for increased economic co-operation among countries with different economic and social systems.\n48.\tIn conclusion, I should like to stress that, although the causes for concern hold sway over considerations of a com-forting and encouraging nature, we are neither discouraged nor pessimistic. Our concerns simply reflect the reality of the millions of the deprived and under-privileged in the third world; our concerns also reflect our firm determination to contribute fully to the solution of the problems we face, matched by our commitment to non-alignment. We are confident that, as the struggle continues, it will find assured victory.\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "GRD_35_1980", "year": 1980}, "spans": [{"start": 94, "end": 101, "label": "GPE", "token_start":

{"text": "\ufeffThe delegation of Ghana\ncongratulates His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko on\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-second session. His long experience in the affairs\nof this Organization and the great qualities which he brings\nto this high office assure us that under his wise guidance\nthe work of this session will be fruitful and constructive. To\nthat end my delegation pledges to him its full support and\ncooperation.\nMy delegation also wishes to pay a special tribute to\nhis distinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Razali\nIsmail, who conducted the business of the fifty-first session\nwith remarkable zeal and efficiency. The promptitude and\nenergy with which he discharged his responsibilities as\nPresident has left an enduring imprint on the work of this\nOrganization.\nTo our distinguished Secretary-General and my\ncompatriot, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, we wish to\nexpress our deep appreciation for his sterling qualities of\nleadership. The people of Ghana are indeed grateful to the\nworld community for having chosen a son to head this very\nhigh and important body. Barely nine months after\nassuming his onerous responsibilities, Kofi Annan has\ndemonstrated an indefatigable energy and commitment to\nthe reform and efficient management of the Organization\nto enable it to measure up to the purposes and objectives\nof its existence. We pledge to him our continued\nunflinching support.\nAt the fifty-first session, Member States warmly\nwelcomed the conclusion of the Pelindaba and Bangkok\nTreaties establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa\nand South-East Asia respectively. We also welcomed the\nadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\nwhich has since been signed by the vast majority of\nStates, including my own. We view these as progressive\nsteps on the road to nuclear disarmament. We therefore\nrenew our call on the nuclear-weapon States to cooperate\nwith the rest of the international community for the\ncommencement and early conclusion of multilateral\nnegotiations on a universal and binding convention\nprohibiting the development, production, stockpiling and\nuse of nuclear weapons, and mandating the destruction of\nthe existing stockpiles.\nWe make these appeals not as an annual ritual but\nbecause of our deep conviction that the elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical\nand biological weapons, will go a long way to promote\ninternational peace and security, a principal purpose for\nwhich this Organization was established.\nWhile weapons of mass destruction deserve the\npriority attention accorded them by this Assembly, the\nquestion of conventional weapons cannot be ignored\neither. The illicit transfer and use of this category of\narmaments are a source of great concern, since they\nconstitute a threat to the stability of States and fuel the\nnumerous conflicts which bedevil the world today,\nparticularly in Africa. They also provide terrorists, drug\nbarons and other criminals the means with which to\npursue their illegal activities. We must adopt all available\nmeans to curb the illicit traffic. In the same vein, we\nsupport ongoing international initiatives to conclude a\ntreaty banning the production, transfer and use of anti-\npersonnel landmines, which continue to kill and maim\ninnocent people and disrupt the economic and social life\nof millions, long after the end of the conflicts in which\nthey were laid.\nThough the end of the cold war has greatly reduced\nthe threat of another global war, which twice in this\ncentury brought untold sorrow to mankind, intra-country\nconflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in\n17\n\n\nseveral countries, with resultant loss of lives, destruction of\nnational infrastructure, displacement of innocent persons\nand outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries. In\nAfghanistan, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, Somalia,\nAngola, Liberia and Sierra Leone and the Republic of the\nCongo, we see the havoc caused by this new trend and its\npotential threat to regional and subregional security.\nWe in Africa are all the more concerned. For while\nthe international community is prompt to react to conflicts\nin regions of economic or geo-strategic interest to the rich\nand industrialized world, conflicts in some developing\ncountries, particularly in Africa, I am sorry to say, fail to\nelicit the same degree of response. Thus, peacekeeping,\nwhich is a primary function of this Organization, has also\nfallen prey to geo-strategic parochial considerations. We\nhasten to warn that such double standards threaten the\nconcept of collective security which constitutes the very\nfoundation of this Organization.\nIn the West African subregion, we have endeavoured\nto fill the gap left by international inertia and selectivity.\nAfter nearly eight years of fratricidal civil war and the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) intervention in Liberia,\ncountries of the subregion, with only the limited assistance\nof the international community, finally succeeded in\nsupervising the conduct of presidential and legislative\nelections in the country in July 1997, under conditions\ngenerally acknowledged to be free and fair.\nWe are happy to welcome the worthy representatives\nof the elected Government of Liberia to this Assembly. For\ntrue and lasting peace in that country, we urge the\ninternational community to stand by the people of Liberia\nas they set out on the difficult road of national\nreconstruction. We are proud to have been part of the\nprocess to restore peace and legitimacy in Liberia, and pray\nthat the Liberian Government and people will continue on\nthe path of national reconciliation in order to consolidate\nthe hard-won peace, which is vital for social and economic\ndevelopment.\nWhile we applaud the return of peace to Liberia, we\ndeplore the onset of violence, disorder and destruction\nfollowing the unjustified overthrow of the democratically\nelected Government of President Tejan Kabbah in Sierra\nLeone. We call on the leaders of the coup to heed the\nunequivocal condemnation of their act by the international\ncommunity and cooperate with the efforts of ECOWAS to\nrestore constitutional order in Sierra Leone.\nIn recent years, my delegation has had cause to\nexpress its concern and regret at the continued imposition\nof unjust sanctions on Libya by the Security Council, in\ndefiance of the expressed wish of the vast majority of\nStates represented in the League of Arab States, the\nOrganization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned\nMovement. We note that Libya has fully met the\nrequirements of Security Council resolution 731 (1992)\nand is willing to cooperate with the other parties\nconcerned in the dispute. We urge the Security Council to\nrevisit the issue and ensure a peaceful solution of the\nconflict and an end to the sanctions.\nWe also reiterate the call of the Non-Aligned\nMovement and other States on the United States of\nAmerica to put an end to the economic, commercial and\nfinancial measures and actions unilaterally imposed on\nCuba, in contravention of the United Nations Charter and\nall principles of international law.\nWe urge the people of Korea to work together in\npeace to realize their aspirations. Since the end of the\ncold war peace on the peninsula has needlessly been\nunder threat on a number of occasions.\nOn the question of Western Sahara, we maintain our\nconfidence in the power of direct dialogue, under the\nauspices of this Organization, as the best means by which\nthe Settlement Plan can be revived to enable the Sahrawi\npeople to exercise their right to self-determination,\nthrough a free, fair and impartial referendum. The news\nthat the Secretary-General\u2019s personal envoy, in the worthy\nperson of His Excellency Mr. James Baker III, has\nsucceeded in brokering a compromise agreement through\nsuch direct talks is reassuring, and we hope that very\nsoon, this long, drawn-out conflict will be amenable to\nsuccessful resolution.\nMay I also avail myself of this opportunity to\nexpress my Government\u2019s regret that the Middle East\npeace process has been put in grave jeopardy by the\nactions of the Israeli Government, which, defying\ninternational outcry, continues its settlement activities in\nEast Jerusalem. For these are the very actions which\nencourage extremists among the Palestinians to organize\nterrorist acts against the Israeli population. We would also\nurge the Palestinian leadership to continue more\nassiduously in its efforts to achieve the objectives of their\ntreaty with Israel through non-confrontational means.\nMany a representative has drawn attention to the\ncontinued and widespread growth of the global economy\n18\n\n\nas we move towards the close of the century and to the\nbroadening of the reach of economic growth in developing\ncountries to include an increasing number of low-income\ncountries. Indeed, many African countries have achieved\nstronger growth of output and incomes in 1996 and 1997.\nThis encouraging trend has been achieved through the\nadoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and\nmeasures aimed at ensuring, among others, macroeconomic\nstability, inflows of foreign direct investment, open and free\nmarkets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory\nframeworks.\nHowever, it is pertinent also to point out that despite\nthese efforts, many African countries, and especially the\nleast developed countries, continue to face important policy\nchallenges, particularly in the areas of enhancing resource\nmobilization and allocation, strengthening savings and\ninvestment and financing development. The difficulties\ninherent in these challenges are compounded by the adverse\nimpact of globalization and liberalization. These countries\nhave not participated in, nor benefited from, globalization.\nOn the contrary, they have become even more marginalized\nin the global economy for the very simple reason that they\nlack the physical, financial and human resources as well as\nthe institutional infrastructure necessary for effective\ncompetition and integration in the international markets.\nIn specific terms our countries, despite various\nstructural reforms, have been unable to attract in sufficient\nquantities the necessary capital inflows for investment, and\nare confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side\nconstraints which limit our export potential, an\nunsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our\nnational income, and declining levels of official\ndevelopment assistance, among others. The \u201cprosperity-\npoverty\u201d gap, or gulf, between the haves and the have-nots\nis ever more yawning.\nUnder these circumstances, what we need is a new\ndevelopment strategy based on genuine partnership between\nthe developed and developing countries and which takes a\nholistic view of development, combining within itself all\nthe tools of development, including trade and investment as\nwell as official development assistance and South/South\ncooperation. Such a strategy will also necessitate the\ndemocratization of international relations, particularly in the\neconomic sphere; the establishment of open, equitable and\ntransparent international regimes; the creation of fair\nopportunities for all; and the protection of the weakest\nmembers of our community.\nIt is in this context that we welcome the successful\nconclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development,\nwhich is intended to serve as an initial framework for\nrenewing and strengthening the partnership for\ndevelopment on the basis of mutual benefits and genuine\ninterdependence. While acknowledging and affirming our\ncommitment to the primacy of national policies and\nmeasures to achieve our development goals, we wish to\nstress the importance of the fulfilment by all parties of the\nglobal commitments aimed at supplementing national\nefforts. In this connection, we express the hope that the\ncommitments and internationally agreed targets reached at\nrecent major United Nations conferences will be fully\nimplemented by all parties. It is also our view that the\nUnited Nations must be strengthened and adequately\nequipped to carry out its important role in development.\nIn seeking to achieve our goals, we the countries of\nthe developing world need to cooperate more among\nourselves as a means of strengthening our self-reliance\nand complementing international development\ncooperation. We therefore need to strive to enhance\ncooperation at all levels \u2014 bilateral, subregional, regional\nand interregional \u2014 in the important areas of trade,\ninvestment, finance, science and technology, environment,\nhuman resources development, and information and\ncommunications. This, in the view of my delegation, will\nconstitute an important strategy for facilitating the\neffective participation of developing countries in the\nglobal economy.\nThe review and appraisal of the implementation of\nAgenda 21 last June revealed worsening trends for\nsustainable development, as well as the continued\ndeterioration of the state of the global environment as a\nresult of the failure of the international community to\nfulfil the commitments it undertook in 1992. This is a sad\nstate of affairs. But even sadder still was the failure of the\nreview session to make any significant progress on the\ncritical issues of Agenda 21, owing to the unwillingness\nof Member States to establish time-bound and quantified\ncommitments. It is absolutely necessary that we all\nrecommit ourselves to the global partnership established\nat Rio in 1992 and to the fulfilment of the obligations\nvoluntarily assumed under Agenda 21.\nGhana has in various forums indicated its support for\nthe establishment of an international criminal court. We\nare gratified that the Preparatory Committee for the\nestablishment of the Court made significant progress in\nthat direction at its last two sessions. We hope that with\nthe same determination and spirit of compromise which\n19\n\n\nhas characterized the work of the Preparatory Committee\nsince its inception, the establishment of the Court will soon\nbecome a reality. We wish to recognize the useful\ncontributions of the various non-governmental organizations\nwhich have worked closely with governmental delegations\non several difficult aspects of the proposed international\ncriminal court.\nProgress on the Law of the Sea also deserves mention.\nWith the establishment of the Commission on the Limits of\nthe Continental Shelf, all institutions envisaged by the\nConvention have now been put in place. It is our hope that\nadequate resources will be made available to these\ninstitutions to enable them fully to attain the objectives for\nwhich they were set up. It is also our hope that cooperation\nbetween the appropriate United Nations agencies and\ndeveloping countries in the sphere of the Law of the Sea\nwill be intensified to enable developing countries fully to\nutilize the benefits conferred on them by the Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea.\nThe critical financial situation of the Organization is\na major source of concern to my delegation, as it places our\nOrganization in jeopardy at a time of challenge and of\nopportunity to promote the objectives and purposes of the\nOrganization. It is regrettable that a number of countries,\nincluding some of the largest contributors, are neither\npaying their contributions nor making good on their arrears,\nwhile some even wittingly aggravate the situation by\nattaching unacceptable conditions or benchmarks to the\ndischarge of their Charter obligations in this regard. My\ndelegation strongly believes that support for the United\nNations must be demonstrated not only by an eagerness to\npromote reforms but more importantly by the willingness of\nMember States to pay all their assessed contributions\npromptly, fully and unconditionally to ensure that the\nOrganization is financially sound and can meet its mandates\nand other commitments.\nTed Turner, an individual with no obligation\nwhatsoever to support the United Nations, has demonstrated\nsupport in a dramatic and yet effective manner. He has\noffered to pay the United Nations $1 billion over 10 years.\nWhat excuse has any country got, then, to say, \u201cWe will\nnot pay\u201d, or \u201cWe will pay only if ...\u201d? On behalf of His\nExcellency the President of Ghana and of the people of\nGhana, I say thank you to Ted Turner for showing us the\nway, for pricking our consciences and for being such a\ngood citizen of the world.\nToday at the fifty-second session, perhaps more so\nthan ever before, the General Assembly is confronted with\nthe complex problem of the reform of our Organization.\nOn the threshold of a new millennium, the United Nations\ncannot continue to conduct its business as usual. It has to\nadopt bold and imaginative measures to overhaul its\nstructure and working methods with a view to removing\nthe obstacles that impede its effectiveness not only as an\ninstrument for promoting international peace and security\nbut also as an indispensable agent for resolving the\nworld\u2019s socio-economic problems.\nIt is in this context that Ghana has carefully studied\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s wide-ranging and far-reaching\nproposals presented to Member States for their\nconsideration and reaction. We warmly congratulate the\nSecretary-General on his bold initiative. The Secretary-\nGeneral has thrown a momentous challenge to all of us,\nand we should do everything possible to measure up to\nthe test by manifesting the necessary breadth of vision\nand objectivity of outlook. The United Nations remains\nthe only international body available to us in our search\nfor peace, progress and prosperity as well as in the\nresolution of differences among nations.\nFor us as a nation, we are particularly interested in\nthe new sense of purpose and dynamism that the\nproposals seek to inject into United Nations development\nactivities to make them more coherent and output-\noriented. We support the setting up of an effective\nmachinery to study the various proposals and how to\nimplement them, and we stand ready to participate in any\nsuch effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "GHA_52_1997", "year": 1997}, "spans": [{"start": 19, "end": 24, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3, "token_end": 4}, {"start": 998, "end": 1003, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 191, "token_end": 192}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1473, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 281, "token_end": 282}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1521, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 289, "token_end": 290}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1533, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 291, "token_end": 292}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1761, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 340, "token_end": 341}, {"start": 1902, "end": 1908, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 371, "token_end": 372}, {"start": 2831, "end": 2837, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 542, "token_end": 543}, {"start": 3821, "end": 3832, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 735, "token_end": 736}, {"start": 3834, "end": 3842, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 737, "token_end": 738}, {"start": 3855, "end": 3865, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 741, "token_end": 742}, {"start": 3867, "end": 3874, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 743, "token_end": 744}, {"start": 3876, "end": 3882, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 746, "token_end": 747}, {"start": 3884, "end": 3891, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 748, "token_end": 749}, {"start": 3913, "end": 3938, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 753, "token_end": 759}, {"start": 4918, "end": 4925, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 950, "token_end": 951}, {"start": 5409, "end": 5416, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1042, "token_end": 1043}, {"start": 5564, "end": 5571, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1074, "token_end": 1075}, {"start": 5811, "end": 5818, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1124, "token_end": 1125}, {"start": 5985, "end": 5997, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1153, "token_end": 1156}, {"start": 6335, "end": 6340, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1221, "token_end": 1222}, {"start": 6424, "end": 6430, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1240, "token_end": 1241}, {"start": 6550, "end": 6555, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1266, "token_end": 1267}, {"start": 6897, "end": 6903, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1338, "token_end": 1339}, {"start": 6907, "end": 6924, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1340, "token_end": 1343}, {"start": 6928, "end": 6935, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1345, "token_end": 1346}, {"start": 7037, "end": 7041, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1365, "token_end": 1366}, {"start": 7153, "end": 7158, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1388, "token_end": 1389}, {"start": 8216, "end": 8230, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1605, "token_end": 1607}, {"start": 8509, "end": 8515, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1656, "token_end": 1657}, {"start": 13260, "end": 13266, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2528, "token_end": 2529}, {"start": 13508, "end": 13513, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2574, "token_end": 2575}, {"start": 15610, "end": 15616, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2963, "token_end": 2964}, {"start": 16155, "end": 16160, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3080, "token_end": 3081}, {"start": 16182, "end": 16187, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3087, "token_end": 3088}, {"start": 16937, "end": 16942, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3242, "token_end": 3243}]}
{"text": "6.\t  Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates, I would, like to express to you our sincere congratulations on your election to this highly esteemed office, the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. We highly appreciate your well-known competence and long diplomatic experience, and we are confident that the work of the General Assembly will fully succeed under your wise chairmanship.\n7.\tI would like to seize this opportunity to extend our congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for his wise and successful leadership of the last session.\n8.\tWe would like also to express our thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his tireless efforts aimed at strengthening the United Nations and furthering its role in the maintenance of international peace and security. His visit last February to our country and other Gulf countries was most successful. He was able to see closely the efforts of our Government in promoting economic and social development. His visit provided us with the opportunity to discuss with him all matters pertaining to the strengthening of the United Nations and the enhancement of its role in the solution of international problems.\n9.\tIt gives me great pleasure to extend our warmest congratulations to the new Members of our Organization, namely, the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde, and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. We are confident that the admission of these States will add to the vitality and universality of our Organization. We are prepared to co-operate in all spheres with these States for the mutual benefit of our peoples and the world at large.\n10.\tAs did the twenty-ninth session, our present session faces problems and challenges of serious dimensions. The peoples of the world look to our Organization with high expectations for the solution to these problems and for the complete elimination of the causes of war and total destruction.\n11.\tNeedless to say, the question of Palestine is one of the most important and urgent problems that requires serious and immediate consideration. We noted with satisfaction the positive way the previous session dealt with this question. The inclusion of the question as a separate item on its agenda, and the adoption of the two resolutions, one emphasizing the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine, including the right of return and the right of self- determination [resolution 3236 (XXIX)], and the other \ngranting the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] observer status to the United Nations and other international organizations [resolution 3237 (XXIX)], were of great historical significance. The inclusion of the item and the adoption of the two resolutions reflected the achievements of the people of Palestine in their arduous struggle. Furthermore, it symbolized the support given by the Arab States, the countries of the third world and other freedom-loving countries to the Palestinian people in their struggle for justice and liberation.\n12.\tOne year has already elapsed since the adoption of the resolution on the rights of the people of Palestine. Yet Israel has not taken any steps whatsoever to facilitate the return of the Palestinians to their lands and properties. Rather, it continues to deny the very existence of the Palestinians as a people, and stubbornly refuses to recognize the right of the Palestinians to enjoy their inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination. It persists, not only in the usurpation of that people's material possessions, but also in deliberately attacking their spiritual and cultural heritage, by abolishing the religious and cultural monuments in Palestine created by the Palestinian people over a long period of history. Nothing could more starkly illustrate this policy of Israel than the continuous threat to which the Islamic and holy places in Jerusalem and Al-Khalil (\"Hebron\") are subjected.\n13.\tIn order to preserve its values and to prevent the deterioration of the present situation which is fraught with imminent dangers to world peace and security, the international community should not tolerate Israeli disregard and defiance of the United Nations resolutions. The proper response by the international community to such defiance of the international will would be in line with the recommendations recently adopted by a great number of States, members of the family of nations, at the Conference of Islamic Foreign Ministers, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Non-Aligned Countries.\n14.\tIn view of Israel's persistent defiance, the three Conferences recommended measures for forcing Israel to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions, including the application of sanctions as laid down in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Hence, it is imperative that the General Assembly at this session should adopt resolutions that go beyond mere reiterated support of the rights of the Palestinian people, and the urging of Israel to implement United Nations resolutions. We should adopt resolutions which include both an unequivocal order to Israel to implement the resolutions, and in case Israel persists in its policy of refusal and defiance, a clear reference to the implementation of the sanctions laid down in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n15.\tAmong the questions that concern us and cause us anxiety is the question of the continuous rule by the racial minority in South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia. Once again, we reiterate our view that the continuing application of the policy of apartheid by the racist Government of Pretoria against the non- white majority of the population in South Africa is immoral, contravenes the principles of justice and equity, constitutes a defiance to human conscience and values, and violates the Charter of the United Nations.\n16.\tOur delegation participated in the Security Council's recent discussion of the questions of South Africa and Namibia. Our participation was motivated by our great concern and deep conviction that the perpetration of such inhuman and illegal situations in those two countries threatens peace and security in Africa, and consequently endangers international peace and security.\n17.\tWe, like our brothers in Africa, sincerely hope for a peaceful settlement of this problem. In the absence of such a settlement, we cannot but support materially and morally the African liberation movements that lead the struggle of their peoples to win back their dignity and to achieve their noble goals of freedom and independence.\n18.\tAs regards Western Sahara, we hope that Spain our friend will respect the resolution of the General Assembly which provided that no action be taken with regard to that territory until the handing down of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice [resolution 3292 (XXIX)].\n19.\tOne of the international problems awaiting urgent settlement is the question of Cyprus. We support the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. We appreciate the sincere efforts made by the Secretary-General to mediate between the two communities with a view to reconciling their differences. We attach great importance to the maintenance of peace and security on the island. This feeling is not only due to its geographical proximity to our Arab region, but also because of the historical, humanitarian and cultural bonds which we share with the parties to the dispute both Greeks and Turks.\n20.\tAs a small developing country, we are deeply concerned with the maintenance of peace and security in our region. Thus, my country warmly welcomed the settlement of disputes between our two neighbors, Iraq and Iran. We congratulate them on this achieve-ment. We also hope that all pending disputes in the Gulf region will be resolved in a constructive spirit of co-operation.\n21.\tWe also wish to reiterate our support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. It is of the utmost importance that this zone, of which we are a part, be free from big Power rivalries. Our goal is to see the Indian Ocean a zone where constructive and co-operative relations exist among its States, based on equality of rights and duties and free from interference by any State in the internal affairs of another. The States of this zone need to mobilize their resources and energies for the development of their national economies and to secure basic necessities which constitute the prerequisites for emerging from the economic and social backwardness from which they suffer.\n22.\tMy Government has also supported the United Nations resolutions regarding the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East. We believe that the best method for the establishment of such a zone is for all parties concerned to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex].\n23.\tAs regards the situation in Indo-China, we warmly welcome the restoration of peace in that region. We wish the peoples of Indo-China every success in their efforts to rebuild what the war destroyed and to develop their national economies.\n24.\tOn the international level, we support the efforts aiming at the easing of tensions among the big Powers. My country considers the results achieved at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held in Helsinki, as positive and useful. The wise steps taken by the two super-Powers to bring an end to their accelerating arms race are well received and supported by us. It is indeed deplorable that this international trend towards the protection of mankind from the scourges of the modern war machine does not find a similar response among the rulers of Israel.\n25.\tThe recent press reports on the pending acquisition by Israel of highly sophisticated weapons of great destructive capability, to be added to its arsenal, are of great concern to us. Indeed, further aggrandizement of Israel's oversaturated arsenal by such lethal weapons would cause apprehension and alarm in all parts of the Arab world. Needless to say, the supplying of the Israeli war machine with such weapons could only lead to the threatening of international peace and security.\n26.\tThis session comes after the successful conclusion of the deliberations of the seventh special session of the General Assembly and in the wake of the adoption of the resolutions of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned countries, held at Lima in August. The resolutions adopted at Lima reflect the new spirit of change which is beginning to find its way into the arena of international relations. The old concepts, based on discrimination among the peoples of the world and on inequality in their relations, have been shaken to their roots. As a consequence of centuries of colonialism, the peoples of the third world, after achieving political independence, have found themselves in a situation of backwardness and are engulfed in an international economic order which does not correspond to their aspirations for advancement and their goals for development.\n27.\tThe individual experience of each people, and the similarity of the problems confronting all developing countries, have led the peoples and the Governments of these countries to search for new avenues in international relations. In their endeavour to establish a more equitable and logical world order that properly reflects their real needs, the countries of the third world have refused to join blocs or alliances, and instead have searched for means of co-operation among themselves, as well as with the other States of the world, based on the respect for sovereignty, democracy in international relations, and the struggle against aggression, colonialism and exploitation in all its forms.\n28.\tIn the economic field, these States called for the establishment of a new economic order, one that is more equitable and closer to meeting the needs ot development and improving the living standards ot the majority of the human race. The Lima resolutions embodied in their provisions the gamut of this historical experience.\n29.\tMy country, a faithful adherent to the principles of the non-aligned movement and a partisan of peaceful international co-operation, has generously contributed to alleviating the suffering of developing countries and to supporting their efforts to advance their peoples and to develop their economies. Immediately after the restructuring of oil prices and the availability of an apparent surplus, my country decided to allocate a large portion of our earnings from our only natural resource, oil, to the support of developing countries, despite a weak and newly created administrative apparatus. In purely numerical terms, our aid has amounted to over a quarter of our gross national product. In real terms, however, when the vast needs of our people for education, hospital facilities, urban development and culture are taken into account, the ratio of our aid to our gross national product greatly outweighs the significance of these numbers in absolute terms.\n30.\tWe also support the positive results achieved by the seventh special session, which we consider as a first step on the road towards full equality in economic relations among States. Though the decisions adopted at that session do not fully meet all the demands presented by the developing countries, we consider readiness to implement them as the yardstick for measuring the good intentions of the developed nations.\n31.\tWe are looking forward with great expectation and optimism to the next meeting, to be held in Paris, on energy, raw materials and development. It gives us great pleasure to serve as host for the next round of the Arab-European dialog, to be held in November of this year, to further explore areas of co-operation between the two regional groupings. We shall do our utmost for the participants and for the success of the meeting.\n32.\tDespite the complexity of the problems of our contemporary world, the successes achieved by mankind in the context of the United Nations during the last three decades strengthen our hope and increase our optimism about the future of co-operation and friendship among nations. My country pledges itself to fulfill sincerely the objectives of the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "ARE_30_1975", "year": 1975}, "spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 75, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 12, "token_end": 16}, {"start": 576, "end": 583, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 106, "token_end": 107}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1424, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 255, "token_end": 261}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1452, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 262, "token_end": 267}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1493, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 269, "token_end": 275}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1559, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 286, "token_end": 287}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1685, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 310, "token_end": 311}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2089, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 390, "token_end": 391}, {"start": 2442, "end": 2451, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 452, "token_end": 453}, {"start": 2865, "end": 2874, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 528, "token_end": 529}, {"start": 2950, "end": 2965, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 542, "token_end": 545}, {"start": 3208, "end": 3217, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 592, "token_end": 593}, {"start": 3223, "end": 3229, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 595, "token_end": 596}, {"start": 3773, "end": 3782, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 689, "token_end": 690}, {"start": 3901, "end": 3907, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 710, "token_end": 711}, {"start": 3975, "end": 3984, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 723, "token_end": 724}, {"start": 4001, "end": 4007, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 730, "token_end": 731}, {"start": 4475, "end": 4481, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 811, "token_end": 812}, {"start": 4752, "end": 4758, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 868, "token_end": 869}, {"start": 4837, "end": 4843, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 880, "token_end": 881}, {"start": 5192, "end": 5198, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 941, "token_end": 942}, {"start": 5311, "end": 5317, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 959, "token_end": 960}, {"start": 5360, "end": 5366, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 968, "token_end": 969}, {"start": 5639, "end": 5651, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1022, "token_end": 1024}, {"start": 5653, "end": 5661, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1025, "token_end": 1026}, {"start": 5666, "end": 5673, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1027, "token_end": 1028}, {"start": 5858, "end": 5870, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1060, "token_end": 1062}, {"start": 6132, "end": 6144, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1109, "token_end": 1111}, {"start": 6149, "end": 6156, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1112, "token_end": 1113}, {"start": 6798, "end": 6803, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1230, "token_end": 1231}, {"start": 7131, "end": 7137, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1291, "token_end": 1292}, {"start": 7199, "end": 7221, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1302, "token_end": 1306}, {"start": 7876, "end": 7880, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1427, "token_end": 1428}, {"start": 7885, "end": 7889, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1429, "token_end": 1430}, {"start": 8388, "end": 8394, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1538, "token_end": 1539}, {"start": 9595, "end": 9603, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1769, "token_end": 1770}, {"start": 9946, "end": 9952, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1834, "token_end": 1835}, {"start": 10013, "end": 10019, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1849, "token_end": 1850}, {"start": 10175, "end": 10181, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1878, "token_end": 1879}, {"start": 10711, "end": 10715, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1974, "token_end": 1975}, {"start": 10754, "end": 10758, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1982, "token_end": 1983}, {"start": 11850, "end": 11856, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2174, "token_end": 2175}, {"start": 12064, "end": 12070, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2215, "token_end": 2216}, {"start": 12273, "end": 12277, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2253, "token_end": 2254}, {"start": 13505, "end": 13511, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2472, "token_end": 2473}, {"start": 13846, "end": 13851, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2535, "token_end": 2536}]}
{"text": "Sir, it is with great satisfaction that we address to the President our congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-first session, His personal qualities as a leader and his diplomatic experience are a guarantee that the serious problems at present confronting our Organization will be properly dealt with so that we shall be enabled to find solutions and thereby to promote the establishment of international confidence.\nWe should like also to express our appreciation for the work carried out during the fortieth session, particularly during the celebrations of the anniversary of the United Nations, and to pay a tribute to the previous president, Mr. Jaime de Pinies. His presidency made a major contribution to the improvement of the Organization's image.\nWe should like also particularly to congratulate the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Peres de Cue liar, for the invaluable contribution and laudable efforts which he has made in the discharge of his duties. Through his wealth of experience, his personal devotion and his enlightened view of our collective problems, the five years of his term of office have been very enriching from the point of view of analyzing and identifying the underlying causes of the difficulties which beset present international institutions and have also made a major contribution to cushioning the impact of the crisis which, as we know, is the fate of all at the present time. Cape Verde greatly appreciated his tenacity and calmness in the difficult hours which the international community has lived through during this time, as well as his resolute courage when the international situation required it.\nEleven years ago the Republic of Cape Verde became a member of the great family of the united Nations, its desire being to make a modest contribution to the building of a world of peace, progress and social justice. Since then the international situation has been steadily deteriorating. Reasons for optimism and confidence have rarely proved to be well founded. Conflicts and disputes continue in various parts of the world. Growing rivalries between the major Powers, particularly in the nuclear field, have led to an increased arms race at unprecedented levels. Imbalances and inequalities between rich and poor nations have become accentuated, whereas despair and poverty have been growing among developing countries, essentially because of the fact that an international economic system which is no longer in step with the realities of the present day world has been perpetuated. These negative phenomena, which seriously threaten international peace and security just when our Organization was last year celebrating its fortieth anniversary, have been mentioned repeatedly by Heads of State and Government.\nThe leaders present on this occasion, conveying the aspirations and concerns of their respective peoples, have emphasized the risks and dangers that beset mankind and have appealed to us to concert our efforts in the urgent task of building peace and co-operation for development, and to work together for the democratization of international relations. We note with deep concern that tension and international crises continue to be constant features of our daily life, with serious implications for mankind.\nCape Verde reiterates its full support for the fundamental principle? that should underlie international relations as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Charter of the Organization of African Unity, as well as in the practice of the non-aligned countries. Furthermore, we reiterate the ethic underlying our foreign policy in seeking solutions which will lead to peace and development. We are certain that only confidence and mutual respect can create a sound and lasting basis for dialog and international co-operation.\nThe negative trends that are today a feature of the relations between States, and which are to be seen in practically all conflicts and instances of tension and instability in the world, are reflected in the activities of this Organization, which came into being 41 years ago on the basis of the sovereign equality of States, an Organization dedicated to building peace and promoting co-operation and development among peoples.\nLike many countries, the Republic of Cape Verde has in the general debate in the last two years voiced its concern over the enormous difficulties confronting this Organization and its specialized agencies in performing their duties and in pursuit of the noble objectives inscribed in their charters.\n\nLike the overwhelming authority of Member states we have always defended the view that there is no alternative to the United Nations. The interdependence of today's world and the multiplicity and complexity of international life at this time require global solutions which transcend frontiers and which can be envisaged only in a universal framework such as that provided by the United Nations, where the legitimate interests of all countries, great and small, rich and poor, are duly taken into account.\nAny attempt to divert international public opinion, which is now focused on collective issues, from the institutionalized multilateral framework of the United Nations, would no doubt satisfy those interests that are prompted by the need to bring about a spirit of national affirmation and create and pave the way for the unilateral imposition of solutions on other countries, but it could also lead - and in fact has led - to a weakening of international institutions as a suitable framework for understanding the problems affecting most States.\nThe problems of world peace and security and of co-operation to further development and human rights are problems which, because of their global nature, affect all corners and peoples of the earth. That is why attempts to find solutions to them are part of a multilateral, stable and proper framework in which all peoples of the world are duly represented.\nThe need for the United Nations as the preferred, if not the sole, forum for finding solutions to our collective problems is becoming particularly acute in the present situation, where developing countries, including Cape Verde, are being confronted by gloomy prospects, particularly in the socio-economic field. If we were all desirous - as many speaking from this rostrum have affirmed themselves to be - of saving the world from catastrophe, of helping to raise the level of mankind and human dignity, thus creating a climate of peace and prosperity for one and all, then all of us, and principally those countries that bear major international responsibility, should give practical effect to their commitment to fulfill the tasks of the united Nations, as well as their firm adherence to its purposes and principles. Hitherto, unfortunately, despite the constructive statements made during the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, very little has been done to eliminate the crisis and restore confidence in the United Nations system.\nOn the contrary, that confidence has been seriously shaken by the financial crisis of the Organization. The financial difficulties are above all, as we know, a reflection of political positions which work to deny the United Nations its role as an institutional framework for dialog on the major international issues of the present day, on the basis of the sovereign equality of States. Thus, if the financial crisis were to be resolved, this would undoubtedly help to resolve the institutional crisis that now besets the United Nations. The institutional crisis, in its turn, cannot be resolved without the political will of all countries. Our common destiny requires us to make national sacrifices in this way.\nThere is no doubt that a great deal could be done towards streamlining the work of the United Nations in order to improve its administrative and financial effectiveness. The creation of the Group of 18 last year, pursuant to a unanimous decision of this Assembly, was dictated by the need to improve the financial and administrative activities of the Organization. He hope the work of the Group will help to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization. The Assembly must pay great attention to the recommendations of the Group and that should lead to decisions that will wake for a stronger United Nations, one which is more confident and better equipped to pursue its objectives.we should like to believe that today we cannot combine the ideals of peace with obsessive preparation for war. One cannot invoke liberation, justice or progress simply in order to disguise hegemonic trends or claims., Respect for the principles and norms governing international relations should not be made subordinate to national interests or become lost in ambiguous interpretations. Yet, in flagrant violation of such norms and principles, tensions are mounting and threats to the world's security multiply because of the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the extension of the arms race into new areas. One display of strength leads to another, in violation of the sovereignty, integrity and political independence of States, and creates a climate of instability and insecurity, particularly among the developing countries. Unprecedented acts of aggression, in total disregard of the norms of international law, are being undertaken under various pretexts against sovereign States Members of the Organization.\nHe cannot let pass this opportunity to express our rejection of the escalation of international terrorism in all its forms, including State terrorism, which, with its accompaniment of innocent victims, is affecting international relations as a whole. The causes of that phenomenon deserve greater attention from all Member States, since recourse to terrorism is all-too-often the result of the injustice, poverty and inequalities that prevail in today's world. It is essential that action be taken to eliminate that scourge by adopting measures and initiatives that take into account the need to eliminate its underlying causes.\nOn the other hand, we cannot tolerate the use or threat of force against sovereign countries, particularly small ones. The use of force in international relations contributes to lack of respect for and weakening of the United Nations. A world in which the law of the strongest prevails is contrary to the concept of a civilized world guided by humanitarian ideals.\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when events in the southern part of Africa are once again drawing attention to the resistance that the forces of apartheid, racial discrimination and colonial tyranny are offering to those working for change in that part of the continent. The possibilities of an\nexplosion of violence, with unpredictable consequences for the continent as a whole, and for the world, are increasing.\nOnce again, apartheid stands exposed before the international community as an abhorrent system of oppression that is historically and universally condemned, particularly in a world like our own, struggling for the ideals of peace, equality, social justice and progress, and particularly on a continent that stands to gain so much from peaceful coexistence and constructive co-operation among its peoples and States.\nOwing to the complex interests involved, current events in that strategic region deserve the full attention of the whole of the international community, for nothing is more urgent than that all turn their efforts and their devotion towards preserving the region from a bloody conflagration.\nThe acts of aggression being carried out against neighboring countries and the important aid being given to puppet units of armed bandits intended to destabilize the Governments of legally constituted sovereign countries, as well as the constant defiance of the norms and principles of international law that govern relations among States, all demonstrate the inability of the present Pretoria regime to enter onto the path of political realism and to accept the idea of the total dismantling of apartheid as the only way to defend the genuine interests of South African society as a whole.\nActs of military aggression, especially those aimed at disrupting socio-economic activities, carried out against the front-line countries, particularly against the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique, are designed not only to destabilize those sovereign countries but also to stifle the economy of the entire region.\nWe should like to express here our serious concern at the increase in the military threats along the southern border of Angola, evidenced by the concentration of South African troops in that region, and following upon the substantial external aid given to the armed bandits of 0N1TA in the form of sophisticated weaponry.\nWe have also witnessed an intensification of the undeclared war being waged against Mozambique which, in conjunction with natural disasters, has increased the problems confronting that sister State.\nWe consider that the whole of the international community has a duty to help the Republic of Angola and the Republic of Mozambique in their struggle to resist aggression and the attempts at destabilization of which they are victims.\nThe critical situation in South Africa has quite rightly been the rocus of the concerns of all countries Members of the Organization. Confronted with an imminent catastrophe that would have unforeseeable repercussions on international peace and security, it is the duty o1 the international community, and particularly of the States Members of the United Nations, in the performance of their collective responsibilities and taking into account the recommendations of the second International Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa recently held in Paris, to adopt appropriate measures to avoid the spread of destruction, suffering, anxiety, death and poverty in southern Africa and to safeguard the opportunities to achieve a negotiated solution to the conflict.\nThe first step towards such a negotiated solution must be the liberation of Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners, recognition by those in power of of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other militant democratic forces and the initiation of serious negotiation among the parties on the future of South Africa.This session of the General Assembly can be of major importance and of historic import if its deliberations can generate measures that can bring the South African regime to the negotiating table. In this connection, and mindful of the relevant resolutions and decisions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of the recent summit meeting of countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, efforts must be made to moderate the adjustments and sacrifices being made by certain countries, either under duress or as a consequence of their application of recommended sanctions, particularly those countries whose territory and population are the targets of military aggression and economic reprisal by the South African regime.\nIn this connection we are pleased at the recent proposal made by the non-aligned countries for the creation of a fund to assist in resisting invasion, colonialism and apartheid, the main purpose of which would be to demonstrate solidarity with the front-line States and the liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia.\nThe situation in Namibia demands our full attention because here, in the present-day international context, we are now witnessing a kind of relegation of the Namibian question to the background, as if the solution of that problem were dependent upon the overall solution of the conflict in southern Africa. We hope that the recent special session of the General Assembly on Namibia will not only breathe fresh life into the manner in which that question has been dealt with but, further, that it will demonstrate that the consistent implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will prove to be an important contribution to reaching a speedy comprehensive solution in the region.\nAs for the Western Sahara, the recent negotiations held in New York between the parties concerned, under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General, have given us grounds for a certain optimism with regard to the possibility of a\nnegotiated settlement of the conflict. We are convinced that continuing such contacts and negotiations is the only way the conflict can ultimately be resolved, and it is for that reason that we have always, in so far as possible, encouraged those involved in that conflict to seek reconciliation through dialog and respect for the sacred rights of peoples to self-determination and independence, in keeping with the relevant resolutions of international bodies on the question.\nWhere Chad is concerned, we reiterate our full support for the actions and initiatives taken by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to bring about national reconciliation, and we continue to hope that the pressing need for peace of the martyred people of that country will be fulfilled. That is why we encourage every initiative in the African framework to bring about a lasting peace with respect for the country's independence and territorial integrity, free of outside interference.\nWith regard to the Middle East, the continuing deterioration of the situation as well as the complexities with which is fraught deserve our Organization's particular attention so that adequate solutions to the conflict can be found. Increased support for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, would be an important step towards securing that people's inalienable rights.\nIn the hope that a just and comprehensive solution will be found to the problem of the Middle East, whose acuteness is becoming more and more evident, we cannot but express our support for the urgent need to convene the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties to the Israeli-Arab conflict, pursuant to the Geneva Declaration and resolution 38/58 C, of 13 December 1983 of the General Assembly.\nWe profoundly regret the crisis in Lebanon attended with heavy loss of life. We pay a heartfelt tribute to the soldiers of peace who have lost their lives in performing the noble duty of preserving peace in the service of the United Nations. Their sacrifice has not been in vain. Their contribution to peace will not be forgotten.\nIn the Gulf area, the war between the fraternal peoples of Iran and Iraq continues to cause untold suffering. We once again urgently appeal to the belligerent parties to put an end to this fratricidal conflict, which has caused such irreparable losses in human life and material damages.\nThe situation in Central America continues to deteriorate and is a matter of grave concern to the international community, particularly the question of Nicaragua, a country which, in keeping with the principles of good-neighborliness between nations, should be able to enjoy the right to choose freely its own political, economic and social system in the interest of its people, without any interference, subversion or threat from outside. The Republic of Cape Verde supports and encourages the efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group to bring about peace and stability to that part of the world.\nIn South-East Asia, efforts should be made to eliminate sources of tension and preserve the principles of respect for sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the States in that area, including Kampuchea.\nWith regard to \"the situation in Korea, we are convinced that dialog and co-operation between the parties concerned is one of the essential prerequisites for the peaceful reunification of the Korean people.\nThe initiatives of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to reach a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan should be encouraged and pursued in order to promote a political solution to the conflict that respects the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the right of the Afghan people to decide their own destiny without any foreign interference.\nThe people of East Timor, the victims of genocide waged against them by foreign forces illegally occupying their territory, have for more than a decade been waging a struggle of resistance the noble purpose of which is to recover their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. These aspirations of the Maubere people, against whom an attempt to reduce to silence has been made, deserve greater attention on the part of the Organization to find a just solution to the question, thus preserving its credibility.\nWe wish to appeal to the international community and, in particular, to Portugal, the administering Power of that Territory, as well as to the Secretary-General, to persist ii their efforts in light of the fact that the most elementary rules of justice make it our bounden duty to continue to mobilize every possible resource in order to create the necessary conditions for the free exercise by the Maubere people of their fundamental rights.\nInitiatives to bring about disarmament are of major importance in the present situation. Not only do they contribute to reducing international tension, mainly among the super-Powers, but they can at the same time pave the way to aeration in the development of the underdeveloped countries by making use of the tremendous economic, human and technological resources that up to now have been devoted to the industry of war. For the developing countries in general and for Africa in particular, peace and disarmament is not merely a question of survival; their economic and social development depend on it.\nThe military presence of foreign countries has been confirmed in the Indian Ocean, despite General Assembly resolutions, in particular resolution 2832 (XXVI) of 16 December 1971, in which the Indian Ocean was declared as a zone of peace. Like other speakers we believe it is necessary to take the appropriate steps in order to demilitarize and denuclearize this part of the world and to turn it into an area of peace and co-operation.\nAt a time when there is a trend towards the geographical proliferation of nuclear weapons, we believe that the experience gained in the Indian Ocean bears eloquent testimony to the need to avoid similar situations in the future.\nHere we wish to refer specifically to the South-Atlantic, a region with its own identity in which the African and Latin American countries comprising it have particular responsibilities and interests that must be safeguarded. We believe that the international community should make concerted efforts to preserve this region as an area of peace and co-operation, remote from international conflicts, thus making a valuable contribution to promoting universal peace. Poverty, famine, malnutrition and sickness threaten the peoples in the developing countries, thus creating an additional threat to the maintenance of international peace and security. While this situation can be attributed to negative internal factors, fundamentally it is the result of the injustice and the imbalance which have been created and furthered by the present international economic situation.\nIn addition to the negative effects of international economic relations on the economies of develop!- g countries, there are the inequalities in financial flows. Liquid transfers from the developing countries to the developed countries have reached alarming levels - $31 billion in 1985, according to a United Nations survey - whereas financial flows in the opposite direction, including public aid for development, have continued to fall off in absolute and real terms.\nThe reduction in public aid for development has increased difficulties in these countries. For many years now capital flows on Favorable terms have diminished, and the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for public aid to development in the international development strategy for the third decade is far from having been achieved.\nThe solution of the economic problems of the developing countries is complementary to resolving the problems of the developed countries. Thus it is in the common interest to strengthen co-operation for development and to introduce a more just new international economic order. In this process, South-South co-operation can play an important part and contribute to creating collective autonomy for the developing countries.\nAfrica, which has the largest number of least developed countries, has been the continent most affected by the present international economic crisis. This situation has been further aggravated by the disastrous effects of endemic drought and progressive desert creep. In order to confront these tremendous difficulties the affected African countries have mobilized their resources in an effort whose success will depend essentially on the size and the promptness of international co-operation, mainly that which binds them to the developed countries.\nCape Verde is situated in one of the most arid and inhospitable parts of the earth - the Sahel - and as part of the group of least developed countries it has been undertaking an arduous struggle for its economic and social development. We still continue to wage the struggle we started 11 years ago when we gained independence. It is aimed at restoring balance in the ecosystem to combat the effects of drought and desertification and to establish the foundations for the harmonious social and economic development of the country. Experience has indicated that, while the struggle for development requires popular participation and a national effort, this struggle is an important component in international solidarity. The Government of Cape Verde very much appreciates the assistance it continues to receive from its development partners. We have been able to make maximum use of this assistance, thus making a significant contribution to solving our economic problems.\nThe problems besetting mankind are numerous and varied. Successive crises and natural calamities recur-, and conflicts persist and proliferate year after year. That is the conclusion reached by statesmen and leaders from all parts of the world who have spoken from this rostrum. In order to describe more accurately and to find a better solution to the various problems confronting us, new ideas have been put forward and suggestions and proposals have been made. However, we have not been able to observe any tangible results. In order to solve the problems related to development, peace, social justice, progress and human dignity, ideas and proposals are not enough. Political will, a vision of the future, a spirit of solidarity among peoples and decisive steps towards international co-operation for development are essential.\nWe have every hope that, as we approach the next century, bold decisions will be taken in order to achieve these objectives. We are certain that reason and human solidarity will prevail.\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "CPV_41_1986", "year": 1986}, "spans": [{"start": 1703, "end": 1729, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 296, "token_end": 301}, {"start": 3921, "end": 3927, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 673, "token_end": 674}, {"start": 4169, "end": 4175, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 719, "token_end": 720}, {"start": 4300, "end": 4326, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 742, "token_end": 747}, {"start": 5623, "end": 5629, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 966, "token_end": 967}, {"start": 7432, "end": 7438, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1292, "token_end": 1293}, {"start": 9171, "end": 9177, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1598, "token_end": 1599}, {"start": 9427, "end": 9433, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1638, "token_end": 1639}, {"start": 11311, "end": 11317, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1973, "token_end": 1974}, {"start": 11942, "end": 11948, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2076, "token_end": 2077}, {"start": 11995, "end": 12003, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2085, "token_end": 2086}, {"start": 12361, "end": 12392, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2150, "token_end": 2156}, {"start": 12397, "end": 12432, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2157, "token_end": 2163}, {"start": 12670, "end": 12676, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2206, "token_end": 2207}, {"start": 12956, "end": 12966, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2255, "token_end": 2256}, {"start": 13148, "end": 13170, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2288, "token_end": 2292}, {"start": 13175, "end": 13201, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2293, "token_end": 2297}, {"start": 13330, "end": 13342, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2319, "token_end": 2321}, {"start": 13865, "end": 13870, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2401, "token_end": 2402}, {"start": 14408, "end": 14420, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2495, "token_end": 2497}, {"start": 15402, "end": 15408, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2668, "token_end": 2669}, {"start": 15441, "end": 15453, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2674, "token_end": 2676}, {"start": 15458, "end": 15465, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2677, "token_end": 2678}, {"start": 15484, "end": 15491, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2683, "token_end": 2684}, {"start": 15841, "end": 15848, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2747, "token_end": 2748}, {"start": 16218, "end": 16226, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2814, "token_end": 2816}, {"start": 18284, "end": 18291, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3180, "token_end": 3181}, {"start": 18639, "end": 18643, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3249, "token_end": 3250}, {"start": 18648, "end": 18652, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3251, "token_end": 3252}, {"start": 19020, "end": 19029, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3314, "token_end": 3315}, {"start": 19308, "end": 19334, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3367, "token_end": 3372}, {"start": 19655, "end": 19661, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3429, "token_end": 3430}, {"start": 19730, "end": 19735, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3445, "token_end": 3446}, {"start": 20006, "end": 20017, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3495, "token_end": 3496}, {"start": 20286, "end": 20296, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3541, "token_end": 3543}, {"start": 20591, "end": 20598, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3593, "token_end": 3594}, {"start": 20871, "end": 20879, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3646, "token_end": 3647}, {"start": 20913, "end": 20922, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3653, "token_end": 3654}, {"start": 21198, "end": 21205, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 3706, "token_end": 3707}]}
{"text": "First of all, I would like to \noffer my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. John Ashe for \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-eighth session. \n\nIn one month\u2019s time, it will have been 70 years \nsince the Foreign Ministers of the four major Powers \nagreed to set up a universal organization dedicated to \nensuring international peace and security. In Moscow, \nin 1943, high representatives of the United States, the \nSoviet Union, China and the United Kingdom took that \ndecision in the very midst of the most devastating war in \nhuman history. They knew that maintaining peace and \nthe creed of \u201cwar no more\u201d required harmonious and \nconcerted international cooperation. They knew that \nit required collaboration among the great Powers and \nrespect for the principles of international law, as well as \nthe building of infrastructure for peace. The declaration \npublished back then rightly spoke of the need to act for \njustice among nations. That is important, because it is \nfrom injustice or from the sense of a lack of justice that \nmany conflicts, both internal and international, have \noriginated and continue to originate.\n\nOn the eve of that anniversary, it is worth examining \nto what extent the international community copes \nwith threats to peace and with open-ended, prolonged \ndisputes. The Organization and its States Members are \nright to be satisfied with the body of work produced \nsince then to help maintain security and peace. The \n\n\n\f\nUnited Nations has proven to be an instrument that, \nsince the Second World War, has made international \nrelations more civilized in very many areas, not just \nin relations among countries but also within them. \nUnderstandably, the world is still far from ideal, but we \nshould not lose heart. A better world is possible, and \nwe should not lose sight of that. That is the real ideal \noutlined in the Charter of the United Nations, and it \nis a duty that belongs to all of us, the Members of the \nOrganization.\n\nThe justified satisfaction with the progress made, \nwhich was ensured with the aid of the United Nations \nand enjoyed by the whole of humankind, cannot hide the \nweaknesses of the Organization and its ineffectiveness \nin situations it was set up to resolve. \n\nOne such current situation is the civil war in Syria. \nThat conflict has led to a large number of victims and \nhas created a major humanitarian crisis. It is a threat \nto regional security and stability. In such situations, \nMembers of the Organization are authorized to \ndemand efficient action by the Security Council. That \nis a justified expectation of ours based on Article 24 \nof the Charter. Regrettably, we must conclude that in \nthe Syrian dispute, members of the Security Council \nhave spoken out for individual sides in the war and \nsupported them in various ways, rather than make the \nparties stop fighting and commit to peace talks. That \nhas revealed the lack of capacity and efficiency of the \ndecision-making mechanisms of the United Nations.\n\nThisis all the more reason not to procrastinate or \nwait for another anniversary as a pretext to return to our \nefforts to reform the Security Council in a way that would \nalso bolster its authority, legitimacy, representativeness \nand effectiveness. We are talking about a more systemic \nsolution that would not limit the Security Council \nbut would go beyond the Council by reinforcing its \nrepresentativeness. We are thinking today about the \nsignificance of the original principle of the right to veto \nof the Security Council\u2019s permanent members, in the \nlight not just of current or future challenges but also of \nthe changes in the global international order, which are \nunfolding before our very eyes. It would be beneficial \nif the discussion about those issues could follow a \nformula similar to the one that proved successful prior \nto the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization, which \nbrought about a rather ambitious reform agenda for the \nOrganization, some of which found its way into the \nWorld Summit Outcome adopted by Member States in \n2005 (resolution 60/1). Poland was an active participant \nin that work and intends to continue its engagement for \nfurther necessary reforms.\n\nThe Syrian tragedy, including the use of chemical \nweapons, is symbolic of a broader phenomenon \u2014 the \nignoring of international values, norms and obligations \nadopted by the Organization and the entire international \ncommunity. After all, they should apply to everybody to \nthe same degree, with no one set outside or above them. \nToo often, the immediate national interests of countries \nhave the upper hand. That leads to tragic consequences \nin terms of human rights and humanitarian issues, \nincluding the principle of the responsibility to protect, \nfor which we had such high hopes when it was adopted \nin 2005. \n\nArmed conflicts are an extreme manifestation of the \nmass violation of human rights. The tragic development \nof the situation in Syria, which has claimed more than \n100,000 victims by now, could have been prevented, \nespecially if the Security Council had adopted the \nnecessary decisions early enough. Therefore, the \nsolution of the difficult, complex and interrelated \nproblems of the Middle East entails a comprehensive, \nimaginative and impartial approach.\n\n\n\nIn a context where everyone is focused on security \nissues \u2014 including new, non-traditional ones, and \nwhere the dominant concerns are the economy. crisis \nmitigation, the fight for growth and competitiveness, \ncompetition for markets and land that could provide \nvaluable raw materials for economic development \u2014 we \ncannot forget about human rights. Recently, many actors \nin the international arena have failed to care about \nthem. But is it possible for us to ignore them, when, for \ninstance, the violations are too close to genocide? \n\nLet me remind the Assembly that this year, on \n9 December, we will be celebrating the sixty-fifth \nanniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the \nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, \nwhich was, by the way, initiated and drafted by the \nPolish lawyer Raphael Lemkin. The message from his \nresearch and initiatives, which started in Warsaw in the \nearly 1930s, is as follows: we must be alert and sensitive \nto the symptoms of future violations of human rights; it \nis our duty to respond to them and not just show moral \noutrage. \n\nAs the effectiveness of the response depends on \ninternational cooperation, the United Nations is to be \n\n\n\f\na centre for such international cooperation. The United \nNations is the best, and often the only, such centre. We \nmust not allow the instruments for the protection of \nhuman rights developed by the United Nations to be \neroded. Their effectiveness will depend upon whether \nwe remain united, and not just in name. It is necessary \nto establish a mechanism that would, in an objective and \nuncontroversial manner, force harmonious cooperation \nbetween the permanent members of the Security Council \nin the face of situations that fall under the principle of \nthe responsibility to protect, in order to ensure that the \nprevention of such crimes and the effective response to \nthem prevail over individual geopolitical interests.\n\nThe practice of exploiting children in armed \nconflicts is particularly saddening and causes a lot of \noutcry. The fact that many Governments tolerate such \npractices and that the Organization, despite existing \nconventions and protocols, is unable to do more in \nthis area is unacceptable. Let me remind the Assembly \nthat the Convention on the Rights of the Child was \nalso developed on Poland\u2019s initiative. For children, \ntheir safety, development and rights, it is the family \nthat matters most. Looking at the family and its role \nin society makes us aware of how much the family \nmeans when it comes to respecting human rights. We \nare particularly sensitive to that in Poland.\n\nWhat in many countries is a tangible but slight \ndeficit in the exercise of economic and social rights, \nwhile in many others it is poverty and chronic \nunderdevelopment. Poverty and underdevelopment are \nnot just human rights issues and factors that undermine \nthe dignity of the individual and entire social groups. \nThey are also the reason that individuals and nations \nare unable to ensure survival on their own, or to fulfil \ntheir creative potential for their own benefit and that of \nhumankind. That is why international efforts aimed at \nhelping regions and countries that suffer poverty and are \nconstantly underdeveloped are so important for them to \nbe able to take the path of sustainable growth and stop \nbeing chronically dependent upon external assistance. \nFirst and foremost, however, that is necessary so that \nfundamental human rights are respected and local \nresidents regain their sense of dignity in order for their \ninherent potential to serve the development and enrich \nthe diversity of the human civilization.\n\nThose objectives will be served by the climate \nnegotiations that Poland is going to chair when the \nnineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange takes place in November. \n\nWe know in Poland that just one single generation \ncan be enough to make unbelievable progress. When \ncommunism fell in 1989, Poland was a poor country, \neconomically ruined and badly indebted. It needed \ninternational aid, not in the form of non-repayable \nborrowing but debt relief and restructuring, technical \nand training assistance, access to markets of better \ndeveloped countries and foreign investment. \n\nCoupled with the hard-working nature and \nentrepreneurial spirit of the Poles, that has all borne \nfruit in abundance. Since then, our gross domestic \nproduct has increased by approximately 400 per cent, \nwhile our emissions have dropped by more than 30 per \ncent, as compared with the baseline year. That attests \nto the fact that it is possible and realistic to achieve \neconomic growth while curbing the growth of harmful \nemissions. \n\nObviously, we are aware that there is no single \nformula for everyone and no single path to sustainable \ngrowth. There are different baseline circumstances, \nenvironments and cultural and geographical conditions. \nThe Polish example, however, and that of other post-\nCommunist countries, should be considered in other \nregions of the globe. \n\nThe same is true for the European development \nmodel of the European Union, which strives to \ncombine democracy and human freedom, economic \ncompetitiveness, social justice and solidarity. It is \nnot about being Eurocentric. It is an experience most \nappreciated by those who come to Europe from the \nfurthest parts of the world and want to stay there. Do \nnot be misled by the economic crisis in the European \nUnion, which most countries in the Union are already \nbeginning to overcome. The European development \nmodel remains universally attractive. \n\nOur experience also suggests that even the most \ngenerous foreign assistance will not replace efforts \nmade internally by a country. It is frequently an \nindispensable precondition, yet is insufficient in \nitself. Internal efforts and factors \u2014 the freedom and \nempowerment of individuals, economic freedom and \nthe stability of the State \u2014 always form the foundation. \n\nGood governance is another important aspect \nof successfully pursuing sustainable growth, as it \ncombines democracy, self-government, human rights, \n\n\n\f\ncompetence, a lack of corruption and the primacy of \nthe interest of the country as a whole over particular \ninterests, whether they are political or economic. The \nentire notion of good governance is spelled out in a \nresolution of the Human Rights Commission initiated \nby Poland in the late 1990s. Only with good governance \nin place can international aid bring about desirable \nresults in combating poverty and taking the route of \nsustainable growth.\n\nPoland is an active participant in the international \ncommunity, and not just through its bilateral relations \nand membership regional organizations such as the \nEuropean Union, or supra-regional ones such as NATO \nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope. We are also trying to create a better international \norder by being active in the United Nations. Poland, an \nunflinching believer in the purposes and principles of \nthe United Nations, is convinced that it is necessary \nto respect the treaties and commitments made by the \nOrganization \u2014 by us \u2014 and supports institutions and \nprogrammes that facilitate their implementation. \n\nFor years, one of the priorities of our policy has been \nthe promotion of human rights and democracy. Poland \ncurrently holds the presidency of the Human Rights \nCouncil. The European Endowment for Democracy was \nestablished on Poland\u2019s initiative as well. Our country\u2019s \nshare in development aid is growing, particularly \nwithin the European Union. Next November, Warsaw \nwill host the climate summit, where we will preside \nover the most important development process, namely, \nthat of climate-related negotiations.\n\nPoland has always been active in efforts aimed \nat ensuring the non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, particularly chemical weapons. \nDrawing on our experience and rich relations with \nother countries, we wish to continue to contribute to \nreinforcing international peace and security. That is \nwhy we are seeking a seat on the Security Council for \nthe period 2018-2019. We believe that as a member of \nthe Security Council, we will be able to help achieve \nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations, as \nwell as represent the interests of Member States in line \nwith the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United \nNations.\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "POL_68_2013", "year": 2013}, "spans": [{"start": 375, "end": 381, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 76, "token_end": 77}, {"start": 417, "end": 434, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 85, "token_end": 88}, {"start": 436, "end": 453, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 89, "token_end": 93}, {"start": 455, "end": 460, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 94, "token_end": 95}, {"start": 465, "end": 483, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 96, "token_end": 99}, {"start": 2299, "end": 2304, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 465, "token_end": 466}, {"start": 4060, "end": 4066, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 803, "token_end": 804}, {"start": 4095, "end": 4101, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 812, "token_end": 813}, {"start": 4964, "end": 4969, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 979, "token_end": 980}, {"start": 6196, "end": 6202, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1223, "token_end": 1224}, {"start": 7624, "end": 7630, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1499, "token_end": 1500}, {"start": 7911, "end": 7917, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1559, "token_end": 1560}, {"start": 9024, "end": 9030, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1763, "token_end": 1764}, {"start": 9212, "end": 9218, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1799, "token_end": 1800}, {"start": 9327, "end": 9333, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1821, "token_end": 1822}, {"start": 11750, "end": 11756, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2282, "token_end": 2283}, {"start": 11932, "end": 11938, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2316, "token_end": 2317}, {"start": 12307, "end": 12313, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2385, "token_end": 2386}, {"start": 12690, "end": 12696, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2457, "token_end": 2458}, {"start": 12816, "end": 12822, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2479, "token_end": 2480}, {"start": 12953, "end": 12959, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2506, "token_end": 2507}, {"start": 13107, "end": 13113, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 2537, "token_end": 2538}]}
{"text": "122.\t  Mr. President, it is my privilege to address this twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly on behalf of the Government and people of Jordan, and to convey a solemn message of salutation and hope from our people on both banks of the river Jordan, a river whose meandering flow reflects the checkered fortunes, and misfortunes, of the people living astride its historic water-bed, from the dawn of history.\n123.\tMy message is, of necessity, mute, but none the less sober and deep-felt. For half our people, on whose behalf I have the honor to address this august gathering, have been suffering the indignity and ordeal of bondage for well over four years since the cataclysm of 1967 and its aftermath.\n124.\tAllow me, Mr. President, to associate myself with all the other delegations in extending to you heartiest congratulations on your highly deserved election to the pinnacle of our universal Organization as President of the General Assembly. Your illustrious career in the service of your great country, your wisdom and dedication, will be invaluable in steering the work of our Assembly to fulfillment of the high expectations which humanity at large cherishes, and which is its only alternative to an appalling and irrevocable course of self-annihilation.\n125.\tMy delegation takes joyful pride in welcoming to the fold of the United Nations the three new Member States of Bahrain, Bhutan and Qatar. We are firmly convinced that their membership will be a positive and most worthy contribution to the goals of universal representation, which goals have all along represented the United Nations aspirations, striving and accomplishments. As they are sisterly countries with which Jordan is inextricably tied by nothing less than national identity, it is particularly my unbounded happiness to welcome to our fold the States of Bahrain and Qatar, and to express the firm conviction that they will, in conjunction with the larger Arab family of people, always be in the forefront in furthering the common ideals of the United Nations.\n126.\tThe Jordan delegation has studied with utmost attention the report of our esteemed Secretary-General U Thant [A/8401 and Add J] concerning the present state of affairs of the world. Its panoramic and incisive analysis of the deepening world crisis is an ominous warning of what lies ahead if the individual and collective will of the United Nations remains lulled into a state of masterly inaction in the face of mortal challenge.\n127.\tIn certain areas of conflict partial progress has been achieved. In other and more serious arenas of conflict little or no progress has been attained. In the forefront of such explosive and unresolved situations loom the dark shadows that envelop the Middle East.\n128.\tThe mortal threat inherent in the situation is not confined to the peace, stability and even survival of this cradle of civilization and its people, for it has all the elements of overflowing to encompass the whole world.\n129.\tMy delegation is not oblivious of the dangers inherent in other areas and in other situations of conflict. We should have liked to follow the usual pattern of running through the long catalog of the items with which the agenda of this year's session abounds. We are fully aware that our fortunes and our fate are inextricably bound to the fortunes and the fate of the world community as a whole, of which we are but. a part-an integral part.\n130.\tBut there are overriding considerations that impel my address to this august gathering to focus on the so-called crisis of the Middle East, even at the risk of appearing self-centered and limited-though, I assure you, we are by no means unconcerned.\n131.\tThere are unique features in the Middle East crisis that make the use of the term \"crisis\" a misnomer, if not downright misleading. A crisis situation invariably involves a conflict between two or more ideologies, Governments and varying patterns of national or international modes of existence,\n132.\tIt is a sad and tragic fact that what is commonly referred to as the Middle East crisis should in fact be nothing less than a total reversal of everything the collective will of the United Nations has painstakingly and proudly pursued over the past quarter-century.\n133.\tThe Assembly is fully aware that one of the cardinal corner-stones of the United Nations Charter is that no country large or small under whatever pretext-should be allowed to conquer and despoil the territories and enslave the peoples of other States, let alone Members of the United Nations. The territorial integrity and inviolability cf every Member State is sacrosanct under the Charter, and forcible conquest is the very antithesis of its being and its rationale,\n134.\tForgive me for repeating platitudes, but when platitudes describe a present, continuing and blatant state of affairs then those platitudes become a stark novelty deserving of our most serious attention.\n135.\tI represent a Member State half of whose people and territory have been the victims of aggression and occupation for more than four consecutive years, and the end is by no means in sight. The situation is as novel as it is tragic, yet who can dispute its existence?\n136.\tWe solemnly, and in the name of our aggrieved people, request this General Assembly to assert in the strongest and most unequivocal terms its determined stand against this unprecedented and unabashed violation of everything the United Nations has been set up to safeguard. We all realize that the United Nations as originally constituted was specifically intended before all else to safeguard peace and to preserve the independence and sovereignty of its Member States., We appreciate full well that Members of this Organization abhor and condemn the flagrant Israeli disregard for those principles of the United Nations, a disregard demonstrated by Israel's continued occupation of its neighbors' territory and its loud and deliberate defiance of United Nations resolutions and pronouncements on the issue.\n137.\tYet the question that imposes itself upon all of us should be this: is the role of the United Nations one of observing, disapproving, condemning and, by inaction, acquiescing in situations that run so blatantly counter to its fundamental premises and innermost fabric?\n138.\tWhat is commonly referred to as the Middle East crisis represents in plain and forthright taJk an openly declared and very-much-boasted-of aggression by Israel on the dawn of 5 June 1967 against three States Members of the United Nations: the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Syrian Arab Republic. The so-called preemptive strike against us occurred with cold and deliberate calculation at a crucial moment when the United Nations and all the Powers, big and small alike, were frantically exerting every effort to arrest the awesome drift to war in consequence of Israeli threats against Syria and inevitable Arab precautionary measures to attempt at least to stem such a threat.\n139.\tThe sequence and unfolding of events since the 1967 aggression and the resulting occupation up to this day are even more telling and more ominous. By words as well as by deeds Israel has nde no secret of its penchant to retain and possess the territories it acquired by aggression and by conquest.\n140.\tFor, as Members all know, shortly after the war the Security Council adopted resolution 242(1967). That resolution was intended to define a just and lasting solution to the problem. Its points were clear, its intent specific. It reaffirmed the established principle that the acquisition of territory by military force is inadmissible and cajleii for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territory they had occupied. It called for an end to belligerency in the area, it guaranteed the right of all States in the area to live in peace and security within recognized boundaries and it guaranteed freedom of passage for all ships wough international waterways. It also called for a just solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees. It struck a balance between the obligations of both sides. It met the natural Arab demand that Israeli occupation of our territory be decisively ended. It provided the guarantees for future peace and security in the area, which the Israelis alleged were the only aim of their policies, and, conditions for ending a temporary military occupation, r\n141.\tTwo principal Arab parties, Jordan and Egypt, accepted the resolution and the obligations devolving upon them therefrom. My Government was repeatedly assured by major Powers in the Council, and especially the United States, that, were the resolution accepted, its implementation by Israel would be ensured and their full weight would be thrown behind it to assure Israel's compliance. The Arab Republic of Egypt was given similar assurances pertaining to implementation. And that was done even before the resolution was adopted by the Security Council in an attempt to guarantee Arab acceptance of its terms.\n142.\tIt hardly occurred to our Governments that the process of implementation was to be subverted and even sabotaged by a game in semantics and procrastination which continues up to this day. The game went so far as to overtax the patience and hope of even the United-Nations representative, Ambassador Jarring, an indomitable and patient diplomat by the most stringent standards.\n143.\tMy Government co-operated fully with Ambassador Jarring, whose terms of reference were defined in the Security Council resolution. Like the Governments of Egypt and Lebanon, it received him repeatedly and responded positively and sincerely to all his questions and efforts. Without hesitation we announced our acceptance of Security Council resolution 242(1967) and expressed readiness to implement our part of it. Israel continued to equivocate about the resolution, sometimes referring only to its \"spirit\", sometimes only to one element in it, 1 sometimes fully ignoring it. Two whole years were spent in this tragic game.\n144.\tIn the second round of Dr. Jarring's efforts, which climaxed in his series of questions addressed to the parties in March 1969, my Government displayed an equally positive attitude. Reaffirming its commitment to an ultimate just peace, it replied in writing:  \"Jordan accepts the right of every State in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries, free from threats or acts of force\". Furthermore, \"Jordan agrees to pledge termination of all claims or states of belligerency\". To another question my Government replied that Jordan would not oppose the establishment of demilitarized zones. And in reply to yet another question by Ambassador Jarring, we stated that in case demilitarized zones are established, Jordan accepts that such zones be supervised and maintained by the United Nations. The Arab Republic of Egypt gave equally clear commitments to peace. In addition, it gave assurances on freedom of navigation in international waterways in the area.\n145.\tThis explicit Arab commitment to the obligations defined in the Security Council resolution was certainly noA matched by Israel. Ambassador Jarring could not get any commitment from Israel on an ultimate total withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, even in the context of complete implementation of the Security Council resolution and the achievement of peace.\n\"i\n146.\tTo forestall a breakdown in the peace efforts, the four big Powers initiated, in the spring of that year, consultations aimed at breaking the deadlock by getting the Security Council to exercise its responsibilities in the matter. Again we welcomed this move in the Council. We regarded it as natural and necessary. Israel vehemently opposed this initiative and opened a violent propaganda campaign against it. It realized that the intervention of the Council was bound to lead to an agreed position that, while peace in the area was the ultimate objective, Israeli evacuation of the occupied territories was a natural prerequisite.\n147.\tThe following year witnessed a deterioration in the situation in the area and frequent resumption of hostilities. It also witnessed a crystallization of a public posture by Israel confirming what we had always warned against: that, peace or no peace, Israel Intended to keep the territory it occupied.\n143. It was this position that led to Israel's clumsy and nervous reaction to the United States initiative in June 1970 to revive the efforts of Ambassador Jarring on the basis of the Security Council resolution. Israel hesitated, resisted, made angry noises about the prospects of revival of United Nations peace efforts, and finally managed to sabotage the initiative and the renewed Jarring mission. Not before it stated explicitly, however, that total withdrawal was out of the question.\n149.\tThe Israeli position has become clear to all by now. The Foreign Minister of Israel in his statement before this Assembly [1946th meeting] made it even clearer. Rhetoric and diplomatic language apart, let us see what the implications of Mr. Eban's statement are.\n150.\tHe went to considerable lengths in his thinly disguised attempt to sell and rationalize expansion. During the past quarter-century the Israelis claimed that Israel harbored no territorial ambitions and that its only aim was to arrive at a lasting peace. Reading Mr, Eban's statement, this is something which belongs to the past and has no relevance to the present or the future. The basic Israeli thesis is now undisguisedly that, peace or no peace, negotiation or no negotiation, territories acquired in 1967 will not be relinquished. This thesis runs through the whole of Mr. Eban's speech, in which he attempts to soften up the world Organization to accept it.\n151.\tWhere would negotiation lead to when the official Israeli position is that, at the minimum, Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and Sharm El Sheikh are not negotiable and that in the rest of the occupied areas more would be annexed on the pretext of security or sentimental reasons? Yet, the Israeli spokesman speaks of negotiations without preconditions.\n152.\tNegotiations, direct or indirect, are a procedure that must lead to a goal. So are arbitration and adjudication and resort to the Security Council. Negotiation is not an end in itself. Mr.Eban makes it an end in itself, and the exclusively legitimate end. But in his preconceived and prejudged position on the substantive issues of withdrawal and territorial inviolability he destroys the very goal of negotiation. Come to the table, he says, with no right to question our decisions to acquire your territory but with the full duty to give our acquisition your seal of approval. This position deprives negotiation of any meaning and renders Mr. Eban's call for negotiation most deceptive and cynical.\n153.\tBut if Mr. Eban's statement extolling the virtues of negotiation is meant to underscore his claim that the world Organization has confined its role to public debate, then the whole General Assembly would be more than justified in taking strong exception to his statement.\n154.\tFor over four years, as I have stated earlier, the United Nations has attempted to promote settlement of the Middle East problem through the various avenues at its disposal.\n155.\tAmbassador Jarring could hardly be accused of engaging in public debate in his thankless task of working to achieve a settlement by quiet negotiation. His mission, as we all recognize, and, as Mr. Eban admitted in his statement, is stalled and in abeyance. He is still awaiting an Israeli reply to his specific questions of last February.\n156.\tThe four major Powers, over an extended period, attempted to promote a settlement, only to give up in despair because of Israel's adamant refusal to comply with the United Nations resolutions and the dictates of law and justice. They were as tight-lipped as Ambassador Jarring, and the only thing that came out of their endless meetings was an announcement informing the world of the date of their next meeting. Has the work of the four major Powers been a world debate of issues rather than quiet deliberation to resolve the crisis?\n157.\tMr. Rogers, the United States Secretary of State, and his assistants likewise engaged in efforts to resolve the crisis. The motto of their efforts was quiet diplomacy, to the point where it almost ran counter to the United States practice of public disclosures on major issues, Has anything come out of these efforts? The General Assembly, I am sure, is entitled to know.\n158.\tMr. Eban has Openly disparaged and disdained United Nations resolutions, including those of the Security Council. To use his own words:\n.. majorities [have] no moral value, little practical effect and a very short life in the world's memory\" (1946th meeting, para. 64].\nIf other Members of the United Nations share Mr. Eban's assessment of its role, then there is little else for it to do but to wind up its business and abdicate its responsibilities under the Charter.\n159.\tMr. Eban was less than discreet when he referred to what he called \"automatic majorities\" in the United Nations [ibid]. What automatic majorities do the Arabs possess other than a rightful cause and an indefensible Israeli position?\n160.\tThe Security Council recently adopted resolution 298 (1971), regarding Jerusalem, with no dissenting voice. Does Mr. Eban wish to tell us that we have a magic formula by means of which we have succeeded in harnessing the support cf all member States of the Council: the aligned, the non-aligned, the European, the American, the African and the Asian, the major Powers and the non-permanent members, respected statesmen representing every color, race and creed? Has it not occurred to Mr. Eban that there must be a reason much more fundamental than the my th of an automatic majority which has caused the Council to act with such unanimity? Perhaps if the Israeli Foreign Minister examined things introspectively for once, he would find the answer and thereby make it easier for all concerned to achieve a fair and equitable solution.\n161.\tAs I have already said, Israel's position has become very clear. Israel will accept peace only if peace is defined as an Arab formal declaration that their territories under occupation be ceded to Israel; that the people in the occupied lands are not their concern ; that the rights of the Palestinians recognized in repeated United Natidns resolutions are forfeited, and that Israeli hegemony in the area and a privileged economic and political position are submissively recognized.\n162.\tWhat kind of peace is that? Which of you would accept this definition in theory, let alone making his own country a field for its application?\n163.\tIf what Israel Wants is.peace and security, then the guarantees for peace and security have been amply articulated in the United Nations documents during the last four years and in the United Nations machinery which we all respect and agree to co-operate with. But security cannot be achieved by continuous incursions into the territories of neighbors and the reliance upon a military machine devouring and feeding on rich foreign sources and increasingly becoming the idol of Israel's society and its ultimate goal. The United Nations cannot accept this concept of security. The Arab countries adjacent to Israel-with their own security and rights-reject such a concept.\n164.\tForeign occupation of the territories of other States is abhorrent in itself by every internationally recognized standard. But when such an occupation is accompanied by the dispersal and expulsion of the victims from their ancestral homeland, the plundering of their lands and means of livelihood, and the undisguised and openly declared intent to take over that territory irrevocably, sooner or later, then the time has clearly come for the international order and those who wish to be its guardian to take stock of themselves and of the system which they purport to uphold. Has the world reverted again to the jungle status from which it has sought and fought to extricate itself? .Does not the world community realize that peace and justice are indivisible; that, if Israel is permitted to reap the bitter harvest of its aggression, then which country in the world, apart from the super-Powers, could feel safe about its; future and its security? Those are questions very real questions which must seriously be pondered by all peoples who have a stake in world peace with justice.\n165.\tThere are three aspects of Israeli occupation which deserve to be highlighted in this context. They are not by any means the only obnoxious ones, but they are the most flagrant.\n166.\tFirst, may I draw the attention of this Assembly to the plight and agony of the half a million of our brethren in the Gaza Strip. Twice or possibly more in a lifetime, they have been condemned to a life of refuge and squalor, herded in refugee camps. For 20 years they had survived their suffering in the hope that they wouH eventually be repatriated, to their homes in their homeland.\n167.\tAnd now the Israeli forces of occupation are expelling the people of Gaza from their hornet, blowing up their houses and forcing them to find shelter in the wilderness of the Sinai peninsula. This is part of a planned depopulation program that will eventually lead to Gaza's being incorporated into the Israeli State. What happens to the people is no concern of the Israelis. It is the land they covet. There is nothing more certain in our minds than that. But if it is the land they want, they will have to struggle for ever to maintain it. As we have said many times, they may choose land or peace. They can never have both.\n168 , The second aspect of the occupation has been the ruthless and inhuman treatment meted out to our brethren in all the occupied territories, in flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the various Geneva conventions governing the basic rights of civilians under occupation and, above all, the inherent and natural rights of the indigenous inhabitants in their own homeland. Thousands of homes in towns and villages have been obliterated on the flimsiest pretext that they had been harboring resistance. Many thousands of youths, young boys and girls, have been languishing in prisons, in numerous instances subjected to torture, off and on for years. Even United Nations investigation of the plight of civilians under occupation was arrogantly rejected by the forces of occupation.\n169. But the peak of the tragedy in the Middle East and its greatest manifestation is the tragedy of Jerusalem. Tragedies can and do befall individuals. But individuals are\ntransient and finite creatures whose suffering passes with their passing away.\n170. But such is not the case with historic cities whose structures, stones, alleys, sacred sights, memories and associations symbolize a soul, immutable and indestructible. The agony A such souls is all the more infinite because it does not perish no matter what the magnitude of the aberration inflicted upon it. And so it is with immortal Jerusalem whose fate has so often been to suffer agony commensurate with its undying glory. It is a city, beautiful, sad and serene. The burden of history left an indelible mark upon its landscape and its people; the cataclysmic past, the uncertainty of the present and the dread fear for the future.\n17 . Where does Jerusalem stand today? It is being defaced and dismantled gradually but persistently beyond recognition. Ugly concrete structures are ringing the city in all directions in violation of the norms which govern the status of ancient and historic cities. The occupied city is being ruthlessly and systematically swallowed by the Israeli State. Its Arab inhabitants, who lived in it for centuries, are being drowned in a flood of imported Israelis, who are demolishing the ethnic, cultural and national character of the city. Through legislation, administrative regulations, transfer of population, and crude physical action, the Israeli authorities are contriving the demise of the occupied \\rab city.\n172.\tThe Israelis call their annexation \"unification\". There can be no unification in bondage, where one community tramples upon the human dignity, the soul and the lands of other communities.\n173.\tThe Israelis claim that Jerusalem was never in history the capital of any nation. Would the Israelis deny that Jerusalem has, throughout history, been the object of infinite veneration, worship and hope for countless millions in the Moslem and Christian worlds? For 1 ;400 years we have been the proud custodians of Jerusalem; centuries before that even before the days of Aw~Jiam our ancestors founded and inhabited the city and ail \"he land around it. It is the roots cf our religious and historical past that bind us to Jerusalem; and we shall never let them be cut off, despite the present Occupation of the Holy City by the military and political forces of Israel.\n174.\tThe Israeli objective is clearly designed to stifle the soul of the remnant of the Arab city and the remnant of its Arab inhabitants. Indeed, the real aim of the so-called Israeli development plan is to cut off Arab Jerusalem altogether from the rest of the West Bank of Jordan and the Arab world, Moslem and Christian, by means of massive intervening structures, and turn in thereby into a virtual ghetto, which the Israelis hope will wither as the years go by.\n175.\tAt its recent emergency meeting, the Security Council adopted resolution 298 (1971) with no dissenting vote, which once again categorically condemned the Israeli aggression in Jerusalem. The resolution reaffirmed previous Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on Jerusalem; it repeated that all Israeli actions in the city are totally invalid and called on Israel to rescind all those actions and measures; it also requested the Secretary-\nGeneral, in consultation with the President of the Security Council and using such instrumentalities as he deem appropriate, including the dispatching of a representative or a mission, to report on Israel's compliance with the Security Council decision. Israel immediately declared, as it has always done, its rejection of the resolution and its defiance of the will of this Organization. Jordan will await the report of the Secretary-General on his efforts, and if Israel persists in its intransigence, then the Security Council and the General Assembly will have to take the necessary action to enforce their will and +o reappraise their relationship with that recalcitrant Member.\n\n176.\tI must pause here to say, in as quiet and unemotional a way as I can, that there will be no peace in the Middle East so long as the Holy City of Jerusalem remains under the domination of Israel. I do not say this emptily; I say it because it is an accepted truth in the mind and heart of every Arab-Moslem and Christian. The liberation of Jerusalem is the corner-stone of peace in the Middle East; it is the essential prerequisite for any move towards the final solution of the problem.\n177.\tIn conclusion, Jordan would like to put its position on record once again. Believing that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is the right basis for an immediate and just peace in the Middle East, Jordan once again pledges itself to its full acceptance. It subscribes to every one of its principles and it agrees to implement its specific provisions. We accept the call for a just and lasting peace contained in that resolution. We are ready to fulfill our peace obligations as defined in it.\n178.\tLet Israel declare its acceptance of the obligations required of it and contained in the resolution-that it end its or pupation and withdraw its forces from the Arab territories it occupied in June 1967. Let the Israeli Foreign Minister come up to this rostrum and declare in unequivocal terms that, in the context of a peace solution, Israel will withdraw from the west bank of the Jordan, from Arab Jerusalem, from the Gaza Strip, from the Sinai Peninsula, from the Sharm El Sheikh, and from the occupied Syrian heights. Let the Israeli spokesman and his Government declare that Israel wants to live in peace with its neighbors and not to live at our expense, by annexing our Jerusalem, occupying our land and enslaving our people. Let Israel declare all that, and the road to peace in the Middle East will be opened.\n179.\tFor almost 25 years Israel has played the theme of peace and peaceful intentions. Now the challenge and the test of intentions are available. It is Israel which has the answer to the question whether there will be war or peace in the Middle East.\n180.\tHie world Organization is, without doubt, at a most crucial cross-roads in the stupendous challenges which confront it, particularly over the Middle East. It is my country's hope and prayer that it will succeed in surmounting the crisis, thereby ensuring not only its own survival but also the survival of a world based on justice, freedom and the rule of law.\n\n\n\n\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "JOR_26_1971", "year": 1971}, "spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 150, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 29, "token_end": 30}, {"start": 249, "end": 255, "label": "GPE",

{"text": "Mr. President, Majesties,\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government,\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegation, Mr. Secretary-General, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nMr. President,\nAllow me at the outset of my remarks to extend my warm congratulations to you on your brilliant election as President of this 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nI see it as powerful testimony to the influence of your country\u2019s diplomacy and the high esteem in which it is held by the international community.\nI can assure you of Gabon\u2019s full support throughout your mandate.\nI would like to commend the work accomplished by your predecessor, Professor Tijjani Muhammad Bande, who, amid a particularly difficult global health context, was able to mobilize our countries\u2019 efforts in carrying out our agenda.\nI also express my appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for the work carried out in strengthening the effectiveness of our Organization and his commitment to implementing the structural reforms underway at the UN.\nMr. President,\nThe world today is at a turning point in its history. We are indeed in the middle of an unprecedented health crisis, which is destroying our societies and taking its toll on every nation.\nIn fact, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to exacerbating the political, security and socioeconomic challenges regularly faced by States.\nSo we must learn the lessons from this multifaceted crisis.\nOne of the key observations apparent to us from the very beginning is our interdependence in the face of any threat to the chain of humanity in which we are all interlinked.\nIt reminds us that the only way to salvation is multilateralism and greater international solidarity.\nIn the light of this reality, the Founding Fathers of our Organization built the conceptual bedrock of collective security that is at the heart of the United Nations Charter.\nOne aspect emerging from the current crisis is the insufficiency of a normative framework in confronting the global challenges facing our world.\nSo, we should reinvent ourselves and act more effectively so as to contain transnational and cross-border threats such as the current pandemic.\nAs our family of Nations celebrates the 75-year existence of the UN, our shared home, we must live up to the values and ideals that guided its creation.\nThis is the perfect setting to welcome the important Declaration adopted on the occasion of the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the UN.\nThis reflects the scale of the task before us and the scope of the commitments to be undertaken to ensure no one is left behind.\nMr. President,\nThe theme of our work is particularly relevant and timely. \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our commitment to multilateralism\u201d are indeed powerful words that call on our respective consciences.\nIndeed, Nations operating individually cannot protect themselves from climate change, tensions associated with trade competition, growing inequalities and the increase in terrorist attacks and acts of transnational crime.\n\u201cThe world in which we live\u201d therefore requires a multilateral system that promotes cooperation for the benefit of all and a pooling of our efforts.\nIn this regard, the reform of the UN Security Council, including equitable representation within it and an improvement in its working methods, has emerged as a necessity and even a critical imperative.\nGabon, through me, remains fundamentally committed to the African common position, as expressed by the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\nAlong with greater international solidarity and the reform of the UN Security Council, the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly as well as the reform of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) must also be carried out in order to stimulate a new dynamic in our Organization.\nMr. President,\n\u201cThe United Nations we need\u201d is also dependent on a redefinition of the missions assigned to the Bretton Woods Institutions, in order to make them real engines of development and global growth.\nThese reforms are essential for the emergence of a fairer international order promoting all of our best interests, as they impact our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, including by responding to the legitimate aspirations of the African peoples as contained in Agenda 2063.\nMr. President,\n\u201cThe United Nations has a natural vocation\u201d to be a response of the Peoples of the world in the face of threats to their aspirations for dignity, peace and prosperity.\nThe United Nations must therefore be humanity\u2019s response against fatality and injustice.\nThe need for action to ensure a more just and equitable multilateral system bears the upshot of stabilizing the prices of raw materials, which are subject to excessive speculation.\nThis is a source of instability that is difficult to reconcile with the predictability of mobilizable resources, which our countries desperately need to be able to achieve their development objectives.\nIn the same vein, more equitable justice would undoubtedly consist in paying countries that possess raw materials a price that is fair for their natural resources.\n\u201cThe future we want\u201d also requires honouring commitments made.\nHere I should like to reiterate the urgency that we solidify the commitments made in favour of developing countries.\nWhether it be in terms of transferring clean technologies or improving people\u2019s access to renewable energy.\nFor us, this involves transitioning from a traditional polluting industry to a low-carbon, environmentally friendly industry.\nFor Gabon, this is based on a foundation made up of three pillars: improved living conditions, the implementation of projects to adapt to climate change and the preservation of biodiversity.\nMr. President,\nDevelopment cannot be sustainable without peace, security and stability. Unfortunately, these fundamentals continue to be challenged in many parts of the world.\nRecurrent terrorist attacks have shown that no nation is immune to this scourge, which is why our response must be based on frank cooperation at the local, national, regional and global levels.\nThrough my voice and in solidarity with the international community, Gabon clearly condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and supports the countries and peoples who fall victim to it.\nMr. President,\nThe price of instability, combined with the effects of terrorism, hotbeds of tension and multifaceted destabilization, is particularly heavy for many African countries.\nIndeed, they are forced to devote significant resources to tackling these phenomena, which are fuelled, inter alia, by the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and the trafficking of species of wild fauna and flora.\nIt is clear to me that in the fight against these sources of instability and fragility in several regions across our Continent, a global and united approach is essential since \u201cany threat to a Nation naturally constitutes a threat to all\u201d.\nIn this regard, we remain resolutely committed alongside the United Nations, the African Union, as well as within the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), to working to promote stability and peace in our States.\nMr. President,\nAt the regional level, I received a mandate from my peers to lead the Institutional Reform of ECCAS, to make our Community more efficient so as to tackle the challenges it was created to deal with, in particular those relating to Regional Integration and Development.\nOn 28 July 2020, the Conference of Heads of State and Government of ECCAS adopted a new nomenclature to reflect the major challenges of the time, notably peace, security and development.\nTo this end, ECCAS\u2019 revised Treaty entered into force on 28 August 2020, and the ECCAS Commission, the new Executive Body of our Community Organization, was established on 31 August 2020, with all of its members having taken an oath.\nDuring its 17th Ordinary Summit, ECCAS adopted a community action Plan for the implementation of United Nations Resolution 1325, including the community\u2019s strategy in response to COVID-19.\nIt also harmonized a set of rules relating to telecommunications, information and communication technologies, cybersecurity and cross-border interconnection.\nMr. President,\nAt the national level, Gabon, like many countries, has suffered the impact of the drastic fall in commodity prices, exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 a situation that has led to the slowdown of its economic activity.\nIn this context, my country has pursued reforms in order to offset the imbalances through economic stimulus measures earmarked for fiscal adjustment, infrastructure development and supporting the private sector as levers for diversifying and transforming our country\u2019s economy.\nToday, we welcome the promising signs that are emerging following the implementation of our Economic Recovery Plan.\nIndeed, thanks to the return to economic growth driven by these reforms, Gabon is gradually regaining room for manoeuvre.\nThese are necessary so as to finance the most urgent areas of investment, particularly in health care, education, training, employment and infrastructure.\nMr. President,\nInclusion is a major concern in my country\u2019s political direction.\nThis is the aim of the political programme for \u201cequal opportunities\u201d that I am promoting in favour of more just and equitable development, enhancing the value of women, young people and the most vulnerable so that no one be left on the margins of my country\u2019s development.\nIn this spirit, I recently appointed a woman to the post of Prime Minister, Head of Government.\nAs a result, three ladies of utmost value, among many good women, now hold very high responsibilities at the highest level of the State.\nThis is the case notably at the Constitutional Court, the Senate and the Office of the Prime Minister. They make an invaluable contribution to consolidating our democratic gains and our march towards progress.\nMr. President,\n\u201cThe future we want and the UN we need\u201d will remain mere unfulfilled wishes while so many people and human beings continue to be burdened with unfair and often unjust sanctions.\nIn this regard, I would like to reiterate the solemn call for the complete lifting of the embargo that has been affecting Cuba for several decades, in order to enable this country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nI cannot conclude my remarks without reaffirming Gabon\u2019s commitment to multilateralism, which is the only way forward in our legitimate quest for a secure future, and in our common ambition to build an Organization capable of meeting the complex challenges of sustainable development.\nUltimately, an Organization that finds appropriate and lasting solutions to the challenges and threats facing humanity.\nThank you.", "meta": {"doc_id": "GAB_75_2020", "year": 2020}, "spans": [{"start": 527, "end": 532, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 104, "token_end": 105}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1385, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 258, "token_end": 259}, {"start": 3424, "end": 3429, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 639, "token_end": 640}, {"start": 5614, "end": 5619, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1036, "token_end": 1037}, {"start": 6240, "end": 6245, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1150, "token_end": 1151}, {"start": 7241, "end": 7247, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1335, "token_end": 1336}, {"start": 8338, "end": 8343, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1541, "token_end": 1542}, {"start": 9019, "end": 9024, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1659, "token_end": 1660}, {"start": 10335, "end": 10339, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1916, "token_end": 1917}, {"start": 10488, "end": 10493, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 1943, "token_end": 1944}]}
{"text": "It is a pleasure for me to be addressing the General Assembly at its seventieth session. Let me begin by congratulating the President on his election at this historic session. We are confident that his vast diplomatic experience will enable him to steer the proceedings and contribute to the achievement\nof the objectives that he has set. Kenya fully supports his leadership and will constructively engage with him as we strive to realize those objectives.\nSeventy years ago, in the aftermath of the Second World War, the United Nations was established with the objective of saving succeeding generations from the recurrence of war. Thereafter, the world took up the challenge of defeating colonialism and its ideologies. That era was also seen as the precursor to greater global equality, increased social equity and the beginning of the fight against mass poverty. It also led to the growth of democracy and freedom.\nToday, the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is being celebrated against a backdrop of numerous global challenges. The adverse effects of globalization, the debilitating consequences of the world economic and financial crisis and the negative effects of climate change have increased the vulnerability of the global economy and affected the States Members of the United Nations to varying degrees. Today, as in the past 70 years, the challenges faced by developing countries, together with their aspirations, including peace and security, development, the protection of human rights, environmental conservation and global governance, remain as real and relevant as ever. They are expected to continue to be the primary concerns for a number of Member States over the coming years.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security continues to face increasing challenges owing to the growing intensity and complexity of conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, especially in the Great Lakes region, the Horn of Africa and the Sahel. The continuing grave security situation in Eastern Africa and further afield is of particular concern to Kenya, which has continued to invest millions of dollars in the maintenance of regional peace and security, while many Kenyans have lost their lives in the quest for peace. We therefore urge the international community, in particular the Security Council, to shoulder its responsibilities in such a way as to make a direct impact in the resolution of those conflicts.\nThere is a need to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, to provide access to justice for all and to build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, as stated in Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals, in order to realize sustainable peace all over the world.\nGlobal terrorism and violent extremism remain a major threat not only to the Republic of Kenya, but also to the entire world. To date, Al-Shabaab terrorists have been targeting the civilian population in Kenya on the pretext that Kenya has deployed its troops in Somalia. The continued threat by Al-Shabaab has had a major impact on Kenya\u2019s national security and economy in general. Kenya therefore calls upon the international community to take strong and enforceable action in combating Al-Shabaab, together with other terrorist groups, including foreign fighters. At the same time, we must collectively address the radicalization of youth as the pipeline for global terrorism, including its financing at the grass-roots level, where most young people are radicalized.\nSomalia is an important neighbour of Kenya. Kenya and Somalia share strong historical, cultural and trading ties that have benefited both societies. Somalia remains of major concern to the international community, and to Kenya in particular, owing to long-standing crises and the security situation, which remains a grave threat to peace and security in the East Africa region and throughout the Horn of Africa. While Al-Shabaab\u2019s capacity to launch terrorist acts inside Somalia has greatly diminished owing to the presence of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and its troops, Al-Shabaab\u2019s continued presence in Somalia has a negative impact on the security, stability and prosperity of that country. The Kenya Defence Forces, within the framework of AMISOM, will continue working closely with the Somali National Army.\nIn spite of the threat posed by Al-Shabaab to Kenya, we will continue to stand firm in support of the Somali Government and the people of Somalia. We therefore call on the international community to support the Federal Government of Somalia in securing its territory. We remain committed, together with other international partners, to providing the necessary support to the Federal Government of Somalia in implementing its Vision 2016.\nKenya is also preocupied by the emerging governance and humanitarian crisis in South Sudan in the aftermath of the political crisis that occurred in 2013. The crisis in South Sudan remains an issue of great concern not only to Kenya, but to the region of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and to the larger international community. Kenya welcomes the recently signed peace treaty, calls upon both parties to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict\nand urges the international community, especially the United Nations, to support the IGAD-Plus peace process and other initiatives geared to the realization of a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace in South Sudan. That should be achieved through the enforcement of the peace and security arrangements, support for the institutions of governance and democracy, support for the demilitarization of South Sudan and a response to the current humanitarian crisis. South Sudan needs to find the path of peace, development and reconstruction, and that needs to happen urgently.\nAt the beginning of this millennium we adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Since then, the MDGs have galvanized and catalysed international action in support of eradicating poverty and realizing other social targets. The MDGs demonstrated that a set of development goals and targets could be important drivers of change. Indeed, where successfully implemented, the MDGs have had a positive impact on the lives of millions of people. But, at best, the results have been uneven. Many developing countries remain off track and have not been able to meet their 2015 deadline.\nIt was therefore necessary to begin a global process to shape a new development agenda, with the starting point being the unfinished business of the MDGs and the creation of a truly transformative and inclusive development agenda as was agreed at the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de Janeiro. The new Agenda \u2014 Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) \u2014 therefore seeks to address transformative challenges that cut across the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development. But transformative and inclusive development does not mean that we can abandon our responsibility to support the countries in the greatest need. On the contrary, as the international community, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that no one is left behind and that no country is left behind.\nThe year 2015 will be remembered in history as the time when it was decided at important conferences that the world should be on a sustainable development path. These began with the third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in March, then the third International Conference on Financing for Development in July, and the General Assembly, with its very recent adoption of the new Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), whose ambitious\noutcome has put us on a a new sustainable development path, with a new set of Goals. The forthcoming Paris session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is also expected to reach an inclusive, balanced, ambitious and acceptable climate change agreement, including its financing, that, we hope, will this time turn plans into actions. The Paris Conference must succeed; failure in this case cannot be an option.\nThe third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, held in Sendai, Japan, underscored the importance of promoting efforts to reduce disaster risks at the international and regional levels, as well as at the national and local levels. The Conference noted that the cost of addressing disaster risk remained a huge burden to many countries. As a result, efforts to address poverty eradication and food security, among other challenges, have continued to be undermined.\nGoing forward, the Conference agreed that it would be important to mitigate the risks of disaster by implementing resilience measures. Member States would have to undertake to reduce disaster losses in terms of lives and the social, economic and environmental assets of communities. The Conference called for the full commitment and involvement of all actors concerned, in particular Governments, regional and international organizations and civil society, including volunteers, the private sector and the scientific community.\nThe Conference also called on Governments to mobilize the required means of implementation in order to address disaster risk reduction, which involves building capacities, especially in defining risk and mainstreaming risk pricing, in order to inform priorities in public expenditures. For effective implementation, capacity-building should cover enhanced global risk analysis and extend to local authorities and others at the subnational level. In order to address risk reduction, sound follow-up mechanism for monitoring and accountability are needed. We are glad to note that disaster risk reduction is part of the new Sustainable Development Agenda.\nAt the third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in July in Addis Ababa, important decisions were reached to follow up on the commitments made in Monterrey and Doha and to further strengthen the financing of the sustainable development framework. The Conference outcome\ndocument focused on both financial and non-financial means of implementation. The required resources will have to be obtained through domestic resource mobilization, domestic and international private finance, business finance and international public finance, which includes official development assistance (ODA).\nHowever, domestic resource mobilization remains key in raising the resources needed to finance development. That means addressing fiscal constraints in the available fiscal space and strengthening the capacities of tax authorities. The non-financial means, which include international trade as an engine of development, debt and debt sustainability, and the taking on of system,ic issues, have also to be implemented. This being said, the role of ODA remains key to upholding the credibility of international development cooperation. It is therefore imperative that development partners continue to redouble their efforts to support and finance programmes in developing countries.\nKenya places great importance on domestic resource mobilization to cover both its recurrent and its development commitments. We have noted the importance of public international finance as a complement to domestic public resources, and we have therefore put in place a national external resources policy with emphasis on sourcing concessional or semi-concessional support for key projects. To effectively coordinate the architecture for the delivery of external aid, we have put in place initiatives to fully implement the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Kenya therefore remains committed to adopting appropriate follow-up and review mechanisms, which will ensure that all the means of implementation are reviewed periodically. Going forward, we need to address capacity deficits in key institutions, such as our national statistical offices, in order to enable them to capture the timely and reliable data required for the follow-up and review process.\nI wish to express my appreciation to the Secretary- General for the successful outcome of the Summit on the post-2015 development agenda. A few days ago, we adopted a bold, ambitious and transformative Agenda for Sustainable Development for the next 15 years. This pact was a culmination of more than three years of intergovernmental negotiations, which began with the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. We are glad to note that the Agenda recognizes as its overarching goal ending poverty\nin all its forms everywhere. The Goals and targets set by the Agenda are universal and will apply to all countries, while different realities and capabilities are nevertheless recognized.\nThis new Agenda acknowledges that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security; at the same time, peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development. That calls for building peaceful, inclusive and well-governed societies, with responsive institutions as the basis for shared prosperity. Fundamentally, the Agenda recognizes that we cannot reach our development goals without addressing human rights and complex humanitarian issues at the same time.\nThe Agenda addresses the requirements for all humankind to be able to live decent lives, free from poverty, hunger and inequality, with all men and women, girls and boys, able to develop their full potential. It commits all of us to being responsible global citizens, caring for the less fortunate and for our planet\u2019s ecosystem and making action commitments regarding the climate, on which all life depends. It is important to note that the Agenda received valuable inputs from civil society, the private sector, academia and parliamentarians, as well as from millions of people from every corner of the world who shared their vision of the world we want.\nKenya is proud and honoured to have played an important role in the post-2015 development agenda process by co-chairing the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and by co-facilitating the intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. It is now the responsibility of all countries to implement this new universal development Agenda. The relevant means for achieving this have been developed and integrated into the Sustainable Development Goals, to be complemented by the outcome of the third International Conference on Financing for Development, to which I referred earlier. Implementation and follow-up will be critical. We will therefore need all partners on board to make it a success.\nTo complete our new path to sustainable development, all of us in Kenya look forward to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in November and December. COP21 is a crucial conference, during which global leaders will need the political will to reach the\nexpected outcome that will enable the Conference to achieve a new international agreement on climate that is applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2\u00b0C. We therefore commend the efforts of France and all others in facilitating the United Nations search for consensus in climate negotiations. Similarly, Kenya will continue to constructively engage to ensure that we reach a meaningful universal climate change agreement that takes into account the issues affecting the developing world.\nKenya is happy to note that the efforts to deepen our regional integration within the East African Community continue to bear fruit. The East African Community remains one of the fastest-growing regional integration bodies and we hope this will continue. The East African Community is committed to widening and deepening cooperation among partner States in political, economic and social fields for our mutual benefit. Over the years, the East African Community has expanded its membership from three founding partners to five, which are now Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. This signifies a wider market that bears great strategic and geopolitical significance and prospects for a renewed and reinvigorated East African Community.\nMuch progress has been made and recorded in the East African Community since the establishment of the East African Customs Union in 2005. We are glad that much more progress continues to be recorded since the establishment of the Common Market in 2010. The Protocol Establishing the East African Monetary Union is already in place and its implementation under way. We remain committed to fast-tracking the process toan East African federation as a demonstration of the determination of the people of East Africa to construct a powerful and sustainable East African economic and political bloc.\nLooking into the future, the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has brought a new dawn for global development. We must collectively avoid the pitfalls of the past 70 years. We must, as a matter of priority, focus all efforts towards ending poverty and promoting sustainable peace and security. We should remain ambitious, yet at the same time practical, in order to bring real change to the lives of the poor around the world, as well as to guarantee the sustainability of our planet.\nKenya will remain robust in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We will build on our experience from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). At the same time, Kenya will continue to pay special attention to fundamental sustainable development issues that were previously left out of the MDG framework, especially strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing global partners for sustainable development, as well as the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, which remains critical to the realization of peace, security and sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, I assure the Assembly that Kenya remains committed to continuing to play its rightful role in the global community, remain an anchor of peace and security in our region, and foster regional, continental and global cooperation for accelerated economic and social development and prosperity for all.\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "KEN_70_2015", "year": 2015},

{"text": "\ufeff42.\tI should like first to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, sincere congratulations on your brilliant election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. In electing you to this important post, the General Assembly has demonstrated its confidence in and respect for you and your country, Panama, which has constantly opted for a policy of independence and the peaceful settlement of disputes in Central America. I am convinced that under your wise leadership the work of this session will be crowned with success.\n43.\tI should like also to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Imre Hollai, who successfully discharged his functions as President of the thirty-seventh session in spite of many difficulties.\n44.\tIt is a particular pleasure for me to congratulate the Secretary-General on his relentless, tireless efforts for peace and international detente.\n45.\tSince the last session of the General Assembly the international climate of detente, peace, security and cooperation has in no way improved; on the contrary the situation has become even more tense.\n46.\tThe Government of the United States has striven to increase its military budget and to step up the manufacture of nuclear and conventional weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, it brought to bear its most eloquent rhetoric in the cause of pushing humanity closer to a nuclear catastrophe. To justify this new escalation in the arms race, it has not shrunk from intensifying the cold war and seeking in every way to sabotage the Soviet- American negotiations at Geneva.\n47.\tThe recent case of the South Korean aircraft, which caused such distress because of the loss of lives of its passengers, clearly showed that the United States was knowingly implicated and took advantage of this pretext to pursue its policy of out and out warmongering and diverting opinion from the massive support that had been won by the peace initiatives of the Soviet Union.\n48.\tTo attain its objectives it has striven to develop its rapid deployment forces and to build and expand its military bases, particularly in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, to defend what it describes as its vital interests, to set out  regional command centers and to engage in many kinds of military manoeuvres throughout the world, pursuing its policy of confrontation, threats, interference and aggression in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n49.\tThe aggression against Lebanon and its occupation by the Israeli Zionists and the brutal crimes they have committed against the Palestinian Arab and Lebanese people were carried out with the avowed co-operation of American imperialism. Under the cover of the so-called multinational peace-keeping forces it has used its air and naval forces to interfere directly in Lebanon.\n50.\tThe Lao Peopled Democratic Republic strongly condemns these acts and reaffirms its unswerving support for the Palestinian people, struggling under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] for its fundamental rights, including its right to create an independent Palestinian State in its homeland, and it demands that Israel withdraw its troops from Lebanon and from the Arab territories, including the city of Jerusalem, which it has illegally occupied since 1967.\n51.\tAn equally unjustified and dangerous action is the American support for the South African racists in prolonging their occupation of Namibia and their continued acts of provocation and sabotage against the African front-line States, particularly Angola and Mozambique. The United States is also engaged in acts of provocation against Libya and shameless interference in the internal affairs of Chad.\n52.\tIn Latin America it has imposed a blockade and threatened aggression against Cuba and is seriously interfering in the internal affairs of El Salvador. It is involved in acts of armed provocation and threats of aggression against Nicaragua, Grenada and Suriname, threatening their independence and thus creating a situation which could erupt at any moment.\n53.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic fully supports the efforts of national defense and socialist construction of the fraternal Cuban people and demands most energetically that the United States abandon its policy of blockade, interference and threats of aggression against the Republic of Cuba, unconditionally  returning Guantanamo to it and respecting its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n54.\tWe wholeheartedly support the heroic struggle of the governments and peoples of Nicaragua, Grenada and Suriname to protect the fruits of their revolution. We wish to express our great appreciation for the six-point peace proposals made by the Sandinist Government.\n55.\tThe collusion between the United States and leading Chinese circles in the pursuit of an undeclared war and their sabotage of the tranquillity and development of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan have constantly maintained tension in the region of southern Asia.\n56.\tIn the Far East, the United States maintains its troops in South Korea and is encouraging a revival of Japanese militarism and the creation of an American- Japanese-Korean alliance which would constitute a serious threat to the countries of Asia and the Pacific.\n57.\tIn the economic Held the developed capitalist countries are seeking by every possible means to inflict upon the developing countries the fall-out of the economic crisis and are pursuing a policy of protectionism and discrimination in their relations with the poor countries, thus imposing upon them ever-growing difficulties. Global negotiations for international economic co-operation, so long awaited, are not taking place, and the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which met last June at Belgrade, yielded very scanty results because of the intransigent attitude of certain developed capitalist countries.\n58.\tThe situation I have described demonstrates that this session of the General Assembly is faced with very important and urgent problems on which rests the fate of the whole of mankind.\n59.\tThey are the problems of safeguarding international peace and security, the struggle against the arms race and the danger of a devastating nuclear war and, first and foremost, against the deployment by the United States of medium-range missiles in certain European countries by the end of this year. \n\n60.\tThey are also the problems of protecting the independence and sovereignty of peoples against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, apartheid, Zionism, expansionism and hegemonism.\n61.\tThey are also the problems of the development of international economic co-operation and the establishment of a new, just and reasonable international economic order based upon respect for the independence and sovereignty of peoples.\n62.\tIn this spirit the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic is happy to note that in the past few years the movement of the struggle of the peoples for international peace and security, for the recovery and safeguarding of national independence and economic development has experienced a dynamic upsurge and has become a powerful force capable of averting war and thwarting the unjust policies of the warmongering imperialists and international reactionaries.\n63.\tThe just struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism and apartheid for freedom and social progress, has received full support from the Lao People's Democratic Republic.\n64.\tWe very much appreciate the proposals of the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty held in January 1983 at Prague, reaffirmed by the meeting of the leaders of those countries last June in Moscow, and the new proposals of Mr. Yuri Andropov, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium , of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, on the banning of the use of force in outer space and from space against the Earth. These proposals, which demonstrate the high sense of responsibility of the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries regarding international peace and security, have been widely welcomed and supported by peoples throughout the world that cherish peace and justice. In the interest of the whole of mankind, American imperialism and the warmongering forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] should examine these proposals in their entirety.\n65.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic warmly welcomed the success of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held last March at New Delhi, the final declarations of which is stressed once again the important role of our Movement. At the same time, we wish to express our great appreciation of the role played by India, which under the leadership of its Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the new Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, works constantly in the common interest of the countries of the Movement.\n66.\tWe whole-heartedly support the peoples of El Salvador, Puerto Rico, Chile and Guatemala in their valiant struggle against the interference of the United States and military dictatorships and for true independence and freedom.\n67.\tAs to the question of the sovereignty of Argentina over the Malvinas Islands, that country continues to enjoy the sympathy of our people.\n68.\tWe energetically support the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization, and the people of South Africa, under the leadership of the African National Congress, in their heroic struggle against the racists of South Africa for true independence and freedom. We condemn the attempts of the imperialists and racists of South\nAfrica to link the granting of independence to Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban volunteers from Angola.\n69.\tWe stand shoulder to shoulder with the peoples of Angola, Mozambique and the other front-line countries which are fighting against the acts of provocation and armed aggression of the Pretoria racists.\n70.\tThe armed provocation against Libya and the violations of its sovereignty by the United States and its tributary forces are energetically condemned by the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, which demands, furthermore, that they cease their interference in the internal affairs of Chad and leave the people of that country to resolve their own internal problems.\n71.\tThe Lao delegation supports the struggle of the Saharan Arab people, under the leadership of POLISARIO, for the exercise of its right to self-determination.\n72.\tThe struggle of the people of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to protect the gains of the April revolution and to follow the path of national construction it has chosen enjoys our whole-hearted support.\n73.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic's approval of the proposal to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace goes without saying. We demand that the United States cease to create obstacles to the holding of the international conference on this problem. We support the sovereignty of Mauritius over the island of Diego Garcia and call explicitly upon the United States to dismantle its base there.\n74.\tWe strongly support the proposals of the Mongolian People's Republic concerning the conclusion of an international convention on non-aggression and on the non- use of force in international relations among the countries of Asia and the Pacific.\n75.\tWe whole-heartedly support the struggle of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification and independence of that country. The United States must withdraw all its troops from the southern part of Korea.\n76.\tSouth-East Asia, which I would like to dwell on in particular, is by virtue of its geopolitical and strategic situation a part of the world which unfortunately has become the object of the greed of the imperialists and the Chinese expansionists. In spite of the failure of their policy of interference and aggression, the latter have not given up their machinations aimed at absorbing the three Indo-Chinese countries as part of their expansionist designs concerning the whole of South-East Asia. They strive constantly to maintain a constant state of tension along the Chinese-Lao and Chinese-Viet Nam frontiers, where their troops are stepping up their acts of armed provocation and sabotage of all kinds, and also along the Thai-Kampuchean frontier, where, in collusion with the American imperialists and Thai reactionary forces, they are using Thai territory as a base for feeding, arming and training the rump of the Pol Pot troops and a handful of Khmer reactionaries to undermine the process of the revival of the Kampuchean people. It thus becomes unmistakably clear that China is behind the deterioration of peace and security in South-East Asia and the hostility between the members of ASEAN and the countries of Indo-China.\n77.\tAfter having won victories in the national liberation struggle against the imperialists, and having thwarted the policy of interference, aggression and annexation of Chinese leading circles, the three Indo-Chinese countries have no other aspiration than to live in peace so as to staunch the wounds of war, reconstruct their countries, build a new life and establish relations of friendship with \nall their neighbours, including the People's Republic of China. The people of Laos, like the people of Viet Nam and Kampuchea, have always cultivated an age-old friendship with the Chinese people and have spared no effort to promote such friendship. The three countries of Indo-china have repeatedly expressed their wish to sign treaties of peaceful coexistence with China and to normalize relations with that country.\n78.\tAs far as the ASEAN countries are concerned, the Lao delegation is happy to note a certain willingness to begin a dialogue. It is highly desirable that this willingness take concrete form. As for the three countries of Indo-China, they have spared no effort to promote such dialogue with a view to making South-East Asia a zone of peace, stability, friendship and co-operation. Accordingly, at their first summit conference, held in February of this year at Vientiane, high-level representatives of Laos, Kampuchea and Viet Nam reaffirmed that:\n relations of friendship and co-operation among the countries of Indo-China and the ASEAN countries are an important factor for preserving peace and stability in South-East Asia. They should settle all differences through negotiation in a spirit of good neighbourhood, coexist in peace . . . They should not let outside countries interfere and divide them or use the territory of one against another.  [-Sec\nAs in the past, Laos, Kampuchea an Viet Nam remain and will remain resolutely faithful to this course.\n79.\tThus, the withdrawal of volunteers of the Vietnamese army from Kampuchea, which has already taken place on two occasions, is a token of the seriousness of our intent and demonstrates the consistent position of Viet Nam in respect of the independence and sovereignty of that country.\n80.\tIn the course of their seventh conference held last July at Phnom Penh, the Foreign Ministers of Laos, Kampuchea and Viet Nam once again repeated their proposals for the restoration of peace and co-operation in South-East Asia and invited the ASEAN countries and China to embark without delay on the process of dialogue and negotiation\tin accordance, with the spirit and letter of the statement on South-East Asia of the seventh conference of the non-aligned countries, held last March at New Delhi. The three countries of Indo-China are ready, on the basis of this statement, to proceed with discussions with their neighbours without preconditions. To demonstrate their good will, they have even accepted the formula of the ASEAN countries for a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, as a basis for dialogue.\n81.\tAs to the problem of the participation of these two groups of countries\u2014Indo-China and ASEAN\u2014in dialogue, as well as the agenda of the meeting, they should be the subject of an agreement between the two parties. In this regard, the People's Republic of Kampuchea made it explicitly known that it has no intention of making its participation a precondition or obstacle to the opening of the dialogue. The Lao delegation believes that this is an important new and very constructive factor which should give an impetus to dialogue between the two groups of countries.\n82.\tAnother new element is the statement on the problems of South-East Asia adopted by consensus at the conference of the non-aligned countries, including the problem of Kampuchea and its vacant seat.\n83.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic considers that the two resolutions constitute a good basis for making progress towards the settlement of the problems between the two groups of countries and for making South-East Asia a zone of peace and stability.\n84.\tAs for the seat of Kampuchea in the United Nations, we regret that the Organization continues to allow it to be occupied by the architects of genocide, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary, under the label of the so-called  Government of Coalition of Democratic Kampuchea . On the other hand we wish to salute the good will shown by the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the sole legitimate representative of the Kampuchean people, which has already stated that it does not intend immediately to occupy the seat when  Democratic Kampuchea  is expelled from the United Nations.\n85.\tIn consideration of the good will thus manifested by the countries of Indo-China, we hope that the United Nations will reconsider its position on the Kampuchean problem so that it can justify the confidence placed in it as the guardian of peace under the Charter and that it will give a positive impetus to dialogue on the problem.\n86.\tThe Lao people, a small people which loves peace, independence and liberty and whose wish is to live in peace and good-neighborliness with all neighbouring countries so that it may devote itself entirely to the development of its country, does not constitute a threat to any one. It is, however, highly regrettable that certain neighbouring countries still consider my country as a target to be destroyed, so that our relations are affected and have deteriorated without any prospects of improvement. On the Chinese-Lao frontier, Chinese troops have massed and have undertaken military exercises, made arrests and executed our frontier guards, have sent spies into Laotian territory and have engaged in propaganda hostile to the policy of the Lao Government and in divisive manoeuvres among the population, and so forth. What is even more dangerous, the Peking leaders are currently maintaining, in Yunan Province in southern China, a certain number of military training centers for Lao refugees, in particular the Hmong reactionaries, in order to send them into Lao territory to carry out acts of sabotage and disrupt public order.\n87.\tThese actions form part of the implementation of the expansionist and hegemonist policy of the Peking leaders with regard to Indo-China and South-East Asia as a whole.\n88.\tIn its relations with the Kingdom of Thailand, the Lao People's Democratic Republic signed the joint Lao- Thailand communiqu\u00e9 in 1979 to strengthen bilateral relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and to transform the Mekong, in the section that forms the frontier between the two countries, into a river of friendship, peace and co-operation. Over the last few years, not only has the Thai administration failed to abide by its commitments in good faith, but some of its leaders who support the American imperialists and the Chinese expansionists have been using Thai territory as a sanctuary to train Lao reactionaries in their work of sabotage against the development of Laos, thus impairing the traditional relations of friendship between the two peoples of Thailand and Laos and working against the interests of the two countries. In the interests of the Thai people and in the interests of friendship between the people of Thailand and Laos, those holding power in Thailand should scrupulously implement the joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by the two countries and seek a settlement of their differences with Laos by means of negotiation.\n89.\tAs regards the United States, it continues, always in collusion with the Chinese expansionists and other reactionary forces, to aid and abet the Lao reactionaries in exile in Thailand, to carry out acts of provocation, to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos and to utter slanderous accusations against its Government about the use of chemical weapons against these bandits, charges \nwhich are renewed each year in the General Assembly. Nevertheless, the Lao Government, anxious to respect friendly relations with the American people and with the worthy aim of normalizing Lao-American relations, has during the year authorized a certain number of American official missions to visit Laos, but to our regret these have led to no concrete results.\n90.\tFaced with the situation I have described, we believe that the international community should do everything in its power to help make South-East Asia a zone of peace, stability and co-operation.\n91.\tThe Lao delegation wishes to take this opportunity to express from this rostrum the profound gratitude of the Government and people of Laos for the sympathy and support which friendly countries and international organizations in the world have given to the defence and construction of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.\n92.\tThe thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly has opened in a climate of international tension, a matter of some concern to progressive mankind.\n93.\tNever has the fight to halt the arms race and promote disarmament, to fight the danger of nuclear war and to promote detente and peace, been such a categorical imperative as it is at present.\n94.\tNever has the fight to overcome imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, domination and exploitation, and to promote independence, freedom and national sovereignty been waged so fiercely and energetically as now.\n95.\tNever have the tasks of economic development and the struggle to establish a new international economic order, more just and equitable, become such urgent and important topics in international life as they are now.\n96.\tNever have the struggles for peace, independence and economic development been so intimately linked, so much the main concerns of the international community, as now. It is quite clear that the deepest aspirations of mankind today centre on peace, national independence, social progress, prosperity, friendship and international co-operation.\n97.\tI with to issue an appeal from this rostrum to all Members of the Organization, to the President of the General Assembly and to the Secretary-General to spare no effort to ensure that this session lives up to the profound hopes of the peoples of the world for international peace and security.\n98.\tFor its part, the Lao People's Democratic Republic will do everything in its power, together with other Member States, to co-operate in that endeavour.\n \n\t\n", "meta": {"doc_id": "LAO_38_1983", "year": 1983}, "spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 380, "label": "GPE", "token_start": 71, "token_end": 72}, {"start":
